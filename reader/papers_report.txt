   title: DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via
  Reinforcement Learning
   summary: We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and
DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement
learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step,
demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero
naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors.
However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language
mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we
introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start
data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217
on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source
DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B,
70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.

   title: MiniMax-01: Scaling Foundation Models with Lightning Attention
   summary: We introduce MiniMax-01 series, including MiniMax-Text-01 and MiniMax-VL-01,
which are comparable to top-tier models while offering superior capabilities in
processing longer contexts. The core lies in lightning attention and its
efficient scaling. To maximize computational capacity, we integrate it with
Mixture of Experts (MoE), creating a model with 32 experts and 456 billion
total parameters, of which 45.9 billion are activated for each token. We
develop an optimized parallel strategy and highly efficient
computation-communication overlap techniques for MoE and lightning attention.
This approach enables us to conduct efficient training and inference on models
with hundreds of billions of parameters across contexts spanning millions of
tokens. The context window of MiniMax-Text-01 can reach up to 1 million tokens
during training and extrapolate to 4 million tokens during inference at an
affordable cost. Our vision-language model, MiniMax-VL-01 is built through
continued training with 512 billion vision-language tokens. Experiments on both
standard and in-house benchmarks show that our models match the performance of
state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering 20-32
times longer context window. We publicly release MiniMax-01 at
https://github.com/MiniMax-AI.
   id: 2501.08313
   ai_summary: The MiniMax-01 series, including MiniMax-Text-01 and MiniMax-VL-01, offer superior long-context processing and match state-of-the-art model performance with longer context windows through lightning attention, Mixture of Experts (MoE), and efficient parallel strategies.

   title: rStar-Math: Small LLMs Can Master Math Reasoning with Self-Evolved Deep
  Thinking
   summary: We present rStar-Math to demonstrate that small language models (SLMs) can
rival or even surpass the math reasoning capability of OpenAI o1, without
distillation from superior models. rStar-Math achieves this by exercising "deep
thinking" through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), where a math policy SLM
performs test-time search guided by an SLM-based process reward model.
rStar-Math introduces three innovations to tackle the challenges in training
the two SLMs: (1) a novel code-augmented CoT data sythesis method, which
performs extensive MCTS rollouts to generate step-by-step verified reasoning
trajectories used to train the policy SLM; (2) a novel process reward model
training method that avoids na\"ive step-level score annotation, yielding a
more effective process preference model (PPM); (3) a self-evolution recipe in
which the policy SLM and PPM are built from scratch and iteratively evolved to
improve reasoning capabilities. Through 4 rounds of self-evolution with
millions of synthesized solutions for 747k math problems, rStar-Math boosts
SLMs' math reasoning to state-of-the-art levels. On the MATH benchmark, it
improves Qwen2.5-Math-7B from 58.8% to 90.0% and Phi3-mini-3.8B from 41.4% to
86.4%, surpassing o1-preview by +4.5% and +0.9%. On the USA Math Olympiad
(AIME), rStar-Math solves an average of 53.3% (8/15) of problems, ranking among
the top 20% the brightest high school math students. Code and data will be
available at https://github.com/microsoft/rStar.

   ai_summary: rStar-Math enhances small language models' math reasoning capabilities through Monte Carlo Tree Search and self-evolution, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks without distillation from larger models.

   title: Kimi k1.5: Scaling Reinforcement Learning with LLMs
   summary: Language model pretraining with next token prediction has proved effective
for scaling compute but is limited to the amount of available training data.
Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued
improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language
models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with
rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In
light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest
multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques,
multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling
and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach,
which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more
complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and
process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning
performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME,
96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching
OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use
long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art
short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on
LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and
Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%).

   ai_summary: A multi-modal LLM trained with reinforcement learning achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across various benchmarks by utilizing long context scaling and effective policy optimization methods.

   title: SFT Memorizes, RL Generalizes: A Comparative Study of Foundation Model
  Post-training
   summary: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used
post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in
enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies
the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing
on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an
arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation
environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen
variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when
trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based
textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data
and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis
reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition
capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain.
Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for
effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling
subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the
capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal
tasks.
   id: 2501.17161
   ai_summary: Reinforcement learning demonstrates superior generalization compared to supervised fine-tuning across textual and visual domains, while supervised fine-tuning stabilizes the model output format essential for RL performance.

   title: Evolving Deeper LLM Thinking
   summary: We explore an evolutionary search strategy for scaling inference time compute
in Large Language Models. The proposed approach, Mind Evolution, uses a
language model to generate, recombine and refine candidate responses. The
proposed approach avoids the need to formalize the underlying inference problem
whenever a solution evaluator is available. Controlling for inference cost, we
find that Mind Evolution significantly outperforms other inference strategies
such as Best-of-N and Sequential Revision in natural language planning tasks.
In the TravelPlanner and Natural Plan benchmarks, Mind Evolution solves more
than 98% of the problem instances using Gemini 1.5 Pro without the use of a
formal solver.

   ai_summary: Mind Evolution, an evolutionary search strategy using a language model, outperforms other inference methods in natural language planning tasks by generating, recombining, and refining candidate responses.

   title: Agent-R: Training Language Model Agents to Reflect via Iterative
  Self-Training
   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) agents are increasingly pivotal for addressing
complex tasks in interactive environments. Existing work mainly focuses on
enhancing performance through behavior cloning from stronger experts, yet such
approaches often falter in real-world applications, mainly due to the inability
to recover from errors. However, step-level critique data is difficult and
expensive to collect. Automating and dynamically constructing self-critique
datasets is thus crucial to empowering models with intelligent agent
capabilities. In this work, we propose an iterative self-training framework,
Agent-R, that enables language Agent to Reflect on the fly. Unlike traditional
methods that reward or penalize actions based on correctness, Agent-R leverages
MCTS to construct training data that recover correct trajectories from
erroneous ones. A key challenge of agent reflection lies in the necessity for
timely revision rather than waiting until the end of a rollout. To address
this, we introduce a model-guided critique construction mechanism: the actor
model identifies the first error step (within its current capability) in a
failed trajectory. Starting from it, we splice it with the adjacent correct
path, which shares the same parent node in the tree. This strategy enables the
model to learn reflection based on its current policy, therefore yielding
better learning efficiency. To further explore the scalability of this
self-improvement paradigm, we investigate iterative refinement of both error
correction capabilities and dataset construction. Our findings demonstrate that
Agent-R continuously improves the model's ability to recover from errors and
enables timely error correction. Experiments on three interactive environments
show that Agent-R effectively equips agents to correct erroneous actions while
avoiding loops, achieving superior performance compared to baseline methods
(+5.59%).
   id: 2501.11425
   ai_summary: Agent-R, an iterative self-training framework using Monte Carlo Tree Search, enhances large language models' ability to recover from errors and correct actions in real-time within interactive environments.

   title: 2.5 Years in Class: A Multimodal Textbook for Vision-Language
  Pretraining
   summary: Compared to image-text pair data, interleaved corpora enable Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to understand the world more naturally like humans. However, such
existing datasets are crawled from webpage, facing challenges like low
knowledge density, loose image-text relations, and poor logical coherence
between images. On the other hand, the internet hosts vast instructional videos
(e.g., online geometry courses) that are widely used by humans to learn
foundational subjects, yet these valuable resources remain underexplored in VLM
training. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality multimodal
textbook corpus with richer foundational knowledge for VLM pretraining. It
collects over 2.5 years of instructional videos, totaling 22,000 class hours.
We first use an LLM-proposed taxonomy to systematically gather instructional
videos. Then we progressively extract and refine visual (keyframes), audio
(ASR), and textual knowledge (OCR) from the videos, and organize as an
image-text interleaved corpus based on temporal order. Compared to its
counterparts, our video-centric textbook offers more coherent context, richer
knowledge, and better image-text alignment. Experiments demonstrate its superb
pretraining performance, particularly in knowledge- and reasoning-intensive
tasks like ScienceQA and MathVista. Moreover, VLMs pre-trained on our textbook
exhibit outstanding interleaved context awareness, leveraging visual and
textual cues in their few-shot context for task solving~Our code are
available at \url{https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/multimodal_textbook}.

   title: REINFORCE++: A Simple and Efficient Approach for Aligning Large Language
  Models
   summary: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a critical
approach for aligning large language models with human preferences, witnessing
rapid algorithmic evolution through methods such as Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), REINFORCE Leave
One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We
present REINFORCE++, an enhanced variant of the classical REINFORCE algorithm
that incorporates key optimization techniques from PPO while eliminating the
need for a critic network. REINFORCE++ achieves three primary objectives: (1)
simplicity (2) enhanced training stability, and (3) reduced computational
overhead. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that
REINFORCE++ exhibits superior stability compared to GRPO and achieves greater
computational efficiency than PPO while maintaining comparable performance. The
implementation is available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF.
   id: 2501.03262
   ai_summary: REINFORCE++ is an enhanced reinforcement learning algorithm that combines PPO techniques without a critic network, offering simplicity, stability, and efficiency.

   title: Search-o1: Agentic Search-Enhanced Large Reasoning Models
   summary: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have demonstrated impressive
long stepwise reasoning capabilities through large-scale reinforcement
learning. However, their extended reasoning processes often suffer from
knowledge insufficiency, leading to frequent uncertainties and potential
errors. To address this limitation, we introduce Search-o1, a
framework that enhances LRMs with an agentic retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mechanism and a Reason-in-Documents module for refining retrieved
documents. Search-o1 integrates an agentic search workflow into the reasoning
process, enabling dynamic retrieval of external knowledge when LRMs encounter
uncertain knowledge points. Additionally, due to the verbose nature of
retrieved documents, we design a separate Reason-in-Documents module to deeply
analyze the retrieved information before injecting it into the reasoning chain,
minimizing noise and preserving coherent reasoning flow. Extensive experiments
on complex reasoning tasks in science, mathematics, and coding, as well as six
open-domain QA benchmarks, demonstrate the strong performance of Search-o1.
This approach enhances the trustworthiness and applicability of LRMs in complex
reasoning tasks, paving the way for more reliable and versatile intelligent
systems. The code is available at
https://github.com/sunnynexus/Search-o1.

   title: The Lessons of Developing Process Reward Models in Mathematical
  Reasoning
   summary: Process Reward Models (PRMs) emerge as a promising approach for process
supervision in mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), which
aim to identify and mitigate intermediate errors in the reasoning processes.
However, the development of effective PRMs faces significant challenges,
particularly in data annotation and evaluation methodologies. In this paper,
through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that commonly used Monte Carlo
(MC) estimation-based data synthesis for PRMs typically yields inferior
performance and generalization compared to LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation
methods. MC estimation relies on completion models to evaluate current-step
correctness, leading to inaccurate step verification. Furthermore, we identify
potential biases in conventional Best-of-N (BoN) evaluation strategies for
PRMs: (1) The unreliable policy models generate responses with correct answers
but flawed processes, leading to a misalignment between the evaluation criteria
of BoN and the PRM objectives of process verification. (2) The tolerance of
PRMs of such responses leads to inflated BoN scores. (3) Existing PRMs have a
significant proportion of minimum scores concentrated on the final answer
steps, revealing the shift from process to outcome-based assessment in BoN
Optimized PRMs. To address these challenges, we develop a consensus filtering
mechanism that effectively integrates MC estimation with LLM-as-a-judge and
advocates a more comprehensive evaluation framework that combines
response-level and step-level metrics. Based on the mechanisms, we
significantly improve both model performance and data efficiency in the BoN
evaluation and the step-wise error identification task. Finally, we release a
new state-of-the-art PRM that outperforms existing open-source alternatives and
provides practical guidelines for future research in building process
supervision models.

   title: Towards System 2 Reasoning in LLMs: Learning How to Think With Meta
  Chain-of-Though
   summary: We propose a novel framework, Meta Chain-of-Thought (Meta-CoT), which extends
traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) by explicitly modeling the underlying
reasoning required to arrive at a particular CoT. We present empirical evidence
from state-of-the-art models exhibiting behaviors consistent with in-context
search, and explore methods for producing Meta-CoT via process supervision,
synthetic data generation, and search algorithms. Finally, we outline a
concrete pipeline for training a model to produce Meta-CoTs, incorporating
instruction tuning with linearized search traces and reinforcement learning
post-training. Finally, we discuss open research questions, including scaling
laws, verifier roles, and the potential for discovering novel reasoning
algorithms. This work provides a theoretical and practical roadmap to enable
Meta-CoT in LLMs, paving the way for more powerful and human-like reasoning in
artificial intelligence.

   title: The GAN is dead; long live the GAN! A Modern GAN Baseline
   summary: There is a widely-spread claim that GANs are difficult to train, and GAN
architectures in the literature are littered with empirical tricks. We provide
evidence against this claim and build a modern GAN baseline in a more
principled manner. First, we derive a well-behaved regularized relativistic GAN
loss that addresses issues of mode dropping and non-convergence that were
previously tackled via a bag of ad-hoc tricks. We analyze our loss
mathematically and prove that it admits local convergence guarantees, unlike
most existing relativistic losses. Second, our new loss allows us to discard
all ad-hoc tricks and replace outdated backbones used in common GANs with
modern architectures. Using StyleGAN2 as an example, we present a roadmap of
simplification and modernization that results in a new minimalist baseline --
R3GAN. Despite being simple, our approach surpasses StyleGAN2 on FFHQ,
ImageNet, CIFAR, and Stacked MNIST datasets, and compares favorably against
state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models.
   id: 2501.05441
   ai_summary: A new regularization approach and simplified architecture for GANs, named R3GAN, surpasses existing methods including StyleGAN2 and diffusion models across multiple datasets.

   title: Agent Laboratory: Using LLM Agents as Research Assistants
   summary: Historically, scientific discovery has been a lengthy and costly process,
demanding substantial time and resources from initial conception to final
results. To accelerate scientific discovery, reduce research costs, and improve
research quality, we introduce Agent Laboratory, an autonomous LLM-based
framework capable of completing the entire research process. This framework
accepts a human-provided research idea and progresses through three
stages--literature review, experimentation, and report writing to produce
comprehensive research outputs, including a code repository and a research
report, while enabling users to provide feedback and guidance at each stage. We
deploy Agent Laboratory with various state-of-the-art LLMs and invite multiple
researchers to assess its quality by participating in a survey, providing human
feedback to guide the research process, and then evaluate the final paper. We
found that: (1) Agent Laboratory driven by o1-preview generates the best
research outcomes; (2) The generated machine learning code is able to achieve
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods; (3) Human
involvement, providing feedback at each stage, significantly improves the
overall quality of research; (4) Agent Laboratory significantly reduces
research expenses, achieving an 84% decrease compared to previous autonomous
research methods. We hope Agent Laboratory enables researchers to allocate more
effort toward creative ideation rather than low-level coding and writing,
ultimately accelerating scientific discovery.

   ai_summary: Agent Laboratory, an LLM-based framework, accelerates scientific research by automating the entire process from idea to report, resulting in high-quality outputs with reduced expenses.

   title: Tensor Product Attention Is All You Need
   summary: Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically
necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory
overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention
(TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent
queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at
inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank
components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA
achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we
introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model
architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of
language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 exceeds the performance of
standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various
metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks.
Notably, TPAs memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer
sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability
challenge in modern language models. The code is available at
https://github.com/tensorgi/T6.

   ai_summary: T6, a new Transformer architecture using Tensor Product Attention, improves language model performance and memory efficiency, allowing for longer sequence processing.

   title: VideoLLaMA 3: Frontier Multimodal Foundation Models for Image and Video
  Understanding
   summary: In this paper, we propose VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced multimodal foundation
model for image and video understanding. The core design philosophy of
VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of "vision-centric" is two-fold: the
vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key
insight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text
data is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing
massive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and
high-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1)
vision-centric alignment stage, which warms up the vision encoder and
projector; 2) vision-language pretraining stage, which jointly tunes the vision
encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data covering multiple
types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as text-only data. 3)
multi-task fine-tuning stage, which incorporates image-text SFT data for
downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for video
understanding. 4) video-centric fine-tuning, which further improves the model's
capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to better
capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is
adapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding
numbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the
number of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the
representation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from
vision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both
image and video understanding benchmarks.
   id: 2501.13106
   ai_summary: A vision-centric multimodal foundation model, VideoLLaMA3, improves image and video understanding through strategic training stages and adaptive vision token encoding.

   title: GuardReasoner: Towards Reasoning-based LLM Safeguards
   summary: As LLMs increasingly impact safety-critical applications, ensuring their
safety using guardrails remains a key challenge. This paper proposes
GuardReasoner, a new safeguard for LLMs, by guiding the guard model to learn to
reason. Concretely, we first create the GuardReasonerTrain dataset, which
consists of 127K samples with 460K detailed reasoning steps. Then, we introduce
reasoning SFT to unlock the reasoning capability of guard models. In addition,
we present hard sample DPO to further strengthen their reasoning ability. In
this manner, GuardReasoner achieves better performance, explainability, and
generalizability. Extensive experiments and analyses on 13 benchmarks of 3
guardrail tasks demonstrate its superiority. Remarkably, GuardReasoner 8B
surpasses GPT-4o+CoT by 5.74% and LLaMA Guard 3 8B by 20.84% F1 score on
average. We release the training data, code, and models with different scales
(1B, 3B, 8B) of GuardReasoner : https://github.com/yueliu1999/GuardReasoner/.
   id: 2501.18492
   ai_summary: GuardReasoner enhances LLM safety through enhanced reasoning capabilities using specialized training datasets and techniques, outperforming existing models on guardrail tasks.

   title: OS-Genesis: Automating GUI Agent Trajectory Construction via Reverse
  Task Synthesis
   summary: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have demonstrated human-like computer control capability. Despite their
utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists:
collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for
collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation
through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or
unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited
data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world
environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI
data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection
process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents
first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then
retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level
exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality
of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with
OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging
online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency
and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis
methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at
https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/{OS-Genesis Homepage}.

   title: MMVU: Measuring Expert-Level Multi-Discipline Video Understanding
   summary: We introduce MMVU, a comprehensive expert-level, multi-discipline benchmark
for evaluating foundation models in video understanding. MMVU includes 3,000
expert-annotated questions spanning 27 subjects across four core disciplines:
Science, Healthcare, Humanities & Social Sciences, and Engineering. Compared to
prior benchmarks, MMVU features three key advancements. First, it challenges
models to apply domain-specific knowledge and perform expert-level reasoning to
analyze specialized-domain videos, moving beyond the basic visual perception
typically assessed in current video benchmarks. Second, each example is
annotated by human experts from scratch. We implement strict data quality
controls to ensure the high quality of the dataset. Finally, each example is
enriched with expert-annotated reasoning rationals and relevant domain
knowledge, facilitating in-depth analysis. We conduct an extensive evaluation
of 32 frontier multimodal foundation models on MMVU. The latest
System-2-capable models, o1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, achieve the highest
performance among the tested models. However, they still fall short of matching
human expertise. Through in-depth error analyses and case studies, we offer
actionable insights for future advancements in expert-level,
knowledge-intensive video understanding for specialized domains.

   title: Cosmos World Foundation Model Platform for Physical AI
   summary: Physical AI needs to be trained digitally first. It needs a digital twin of
itself, the policy model, and a digital twin of the world, the world model. In
this paper, we present the Cosmos World Foundation Model Platform to help
developers build customized world models for their Physical AI setups. We
position a world foundation model as a general-purpose world model that can be
fine-tuned into customized world models for downstream applications. Our
platform covers a video curation pipeline, pre-trained world foundation models,
examples of post-training of pre-trained world foundation models, and video
tokenizers. To help Physical AI builders solve the most critical problems of
our society, we make our platform open-source and our models open-weight with
permissive licenses available via https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos.

   title: Humanity's Last Exam
   summary: Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large
language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in
difficulty: LLMs now achieve over 90\% accuracy on popular benchmarks like
MMLU, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. In
response, we introduce Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at
the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be the final closed-ended academic
benchmark of its kind with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 3,000
questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities, and the
natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and
consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated
grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily
verifiable, but cannot be quickly answered via internet retrieval.
State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE,
highlighting a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert
human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and
policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly
release HLE at https://lastexam.ai.

   ai_summary: HLE is a challenging multi-modal benchmark that highlights the limitations of current LLMs in closed-ended academic questions.

   title: VideoRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Video Corpus
   summary: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful strategy to address the
issue of generating factually incorrect outputs in foundation models by
retrieving external knowledge relevant to queries and incorporating it into
their generation process. However, existing RAG approaches have primarily
focused on textual information, with some recent advancements beginning to
consider images, and they largely overlook videos, a rich source of multimodal
knowledge capable of representing events, processes, and contextual details
more effectively than any other modality. While a few recent studies explore
the integration of videos in the response generation process, they either
predefine query-associated videos without retrieving them according to queries,
or convert videos into the textual descriptions without harnessing their
multimodal richness. To tackle these, we introduce VideoRAG, a novel framework
that not only dynamically retrieves relevant videos based on their relevance
with queries but also utilizes both visual and textual information of videos in
the output generation. Further, to operationalize this, our method revolves
around the recent advance of Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), which enable

   title: FilmAgent: A Multi-Agent Framework for End-to-End Film Automation in
  Virtual 3D Spaces
   summary: Virtual film production requires intricate decision-making processes,
including scriptwriting, virtual cinematography, and precise actor positioning
and actions. Motivated by recent advances in automated decision-making with
language agent-based societies, this paper introduces FilmAgent, a novel
LLM-based multi-agent collaborative framework for end-to-end film automation in
our constructed 3D virtual spaces. FilmAgent simulates various crew roles,
including directors, screenwriters, actors, and cinematographers, and covers
key stages of a film production workflow: (1) idea development transforms
brainstormed ideas into structured story outlines; (2) scriptwriting elaborates
on dialogue and character actions for each scene; (3) cinematography determines
the camera setups for each shot. A team of agents collaborates through
iterative feedback and revisions, thereby verifying intermediate scripts and
reducing hallucinations. We evaluate the generated videos on 15 ideas and 4 key
aspects. Human evaluation shows that FilmAgent outperforms all baselines across
all aspects and scores 3.98 out of 5 on average, showing the feasibility of
multi-agent collaboration in filmmaking. Further analysis reveals that
FilmAgent, despite using the less advanced GPT-4o model, surpasses the
single-agent o1, showing the advantage of a well-coordinated multi-agent
system. Lastly, we discuss the complementary strengths and weaknesses of
OpenAI's text-to-video model Sora and our FilmAgent in filmmaking.

   title: Qwen2.5-1M Technical Report
   summary: We introduce Qwen2.5-1M, a series of models that extend the context length to
1 million tokens. Compared to the previous 128K version, the Qwen2.5-1M series
have significantly enhanced long-context capabilities through long-context
pre-training and post-training. Key techniques such as long data synthesis,
progressive pre-training, and multi-stage supervised fine-tuning are employed
to effectively enhance long-context performance while reducing training costs.
  To promote the use of long-context models among a broader user base, we
present and open-source our inference framework. This framework includes a
length extrapolation method that can expand the model context lengths by at
least four times, or even more, without additional training. To reduce
inference costs, we implement a sparse attention method along with chunked
prefill optimization for deployment scenarios and a sparsity refinement method
to improve precision. Additionally, we detail our optimizations in the
inference engine, including kernel optimization, pipeline parallelism, and
scheduling optimization, which significantly enhance overall inference
performance. By leveraging our inference framework, the Qwen2.5-1M models
achieve a remarkable 3x to 7x prefill speedup in scenarios with 1 million
tokens of context. This framework provides an efficient and powerful solution
for developing applications that require long-context processing using
open-source models.
  The Qwen2.5-1M series currently includes the open-source models
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M, as well as the API-accessed
model Qwen2.5-Turbo. Evaluations show that Qwen2.5-1M models have been greatly
improved in long-context tasks without compromising performance in
short-context scenarios. Specifically, the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M model
significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini in long-context tasks and supports
contexts eight times longer.
   id: 2501.15383
   ai_summary: The Qwen2.5-1M series models extend context length to 1 million tokens with enhanced long-context capabilities, employing techniques like long data synthesis and progressive pre-training, and are supported by an open-source inference framework with sparse attention and kernel optimizations.

   title: Inference-Time Scaling for Diffusion Models beyond Scaling Denoising
  Steps
   summary: Generative models have made significant impacts across various domains,
largely due to their ability to scale during training by increasing data,
computational resources, and model size, a phenomenon characterized by the
scaling laws. Recent research has begun to explore inference-time scaling
behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing how performance can further
improve with additional computation during inference. Unlike LLMs, diffusion
models inherently possess the flexibility to adjust inference-time computation
via the number of denoising steps, although the performance gains typically
flatten after a few dozen. In this work, we explore the inference-time scaling
behavior of diffusion models beyond increasing denoising steps and investigate
how the generation performance can further improve with increased computation.
Specifically, we consider a search problem aimed at identifying better noises
for the diffusion sampling process. We structure the design space along two
axes: the verifiers used to provide feedback, and the algorithms used to find
better noise candidates. Through extensive experiments on class-conditioned and
text-conditioned image generation benchmarks, our findings reveal that
increasing inference-time compute leads to substantial improvements in the
quality of samples generated by diffusion models, and with the complicated
nature of images, combinations of the components in the framework can be
specifically chosen to conform with different application scenario.

   title: Enabling Scalable Oversight via Self-Evolving Critic
   summary: Despite their remarkable performance, the development of Large Language
Models (LLMs) faces a critical challenge in scalable oversight: providing
effective feedback for tasks where human evaluation is difficult or where LLMs
outperform humans. While there is growing interest in using LLMs for critique,
current approaches still rely on human annotations or more powerful models,
leaving the issue of enhancing critique capabilities without external
supervision unresolved. We introduce SCRIT (Self-evolving CRITic), a framework
that enables genuine self-evolution of critique abilities. Technically, SCRIT
self-improves by training on synthetic data, generated by a contrastive-based
self-critic that uses reference solutions for step-by-step critique, and a
self-validation mechanism that ensures critique quality through correction
outcomes. Implemented with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, one of the most powerful LLMs,
SCRIT achieves up to a 10.3\% improvement on critique-correction and error
identification benchmarks. Our analysis reveals that SCRIT's performance scales
positively with data and model size, outperforms alternative approaches, and
benefits critically from its self-validation component.

   ai_summary: SCRIT, a self-evolving critique framework, enhances LLMs' critique capabilities using synthetic data and self-validation, achieving significant improvements in critique-correction and error identification benchmarks.

   title: SRMT: Shared Memory for Multi-agent Lifelong Pathfinding
   summary: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) demonstrates significant progress
in solving cooperative and competitive multi-agent problems in various
environments. One of the principal challenges in MARL is the need for explicit
prediction of the agents' behavior to achieve cooperation. To resolve this
issue, we propose the Shared Recurrent Memory Transformer (SRMT) which extends
memory transformers to multi-agent settings by pooling and globally
broadcasting individual working memories, enabling agents to exchange
information implicitly and coordinate their actions. We evaluate SRMT on the
Partially Observable Multi-Agent Pathfinding problem in a toy Bottleneck
navigation task that requires agents to pass through a narrow corridor and on a
POGEMA benchmark set of tasks. In the Bottleneck task, SRMT consistently
outperforms a variety of reinforcement learning baselines, especially under
sparse rewards, and generalizes effectively to longer corridors than those seen
during training. On POGEMA maps, including Mazes, Random, and MovingAI, SRMT is
competitive with recent MARL, hybrid, and planning-based algorithms. These
results suggest that incorporating shared recurrent memory into the
transformer-based architectures can enhance coordination in decentralized
multi-agent systems. The source code for training and evaluation is available
on GitHub: https://github.com/Aloriosa/srmt.

   title: Demons in the Detail: On Implementing Load Balancing Loss for Training
  Specialized Mixture-of-Expert Models
   summary: This paper revisits the implementation of
Load-balancing Loss (LBL) when training
Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) models. Specifically, LBL for MoEs is defined as N_E
sum_{i=1}^{N_E} f_i p_i, where N_E is the total number of experts, f_i
represents the frequency of expert i being selected, and p_i denotes the
average gating score of the expert i. Existing MoE training frameworks
usually employ the parallel training strategy so that f_i and the LBL are
calculated within a micro-batch and then averaged across parallel
groups. In essence, a micro-batch for training billion-scale LLMs normally
contains very few sequences. So, the micro-batch LBL is almost at the sequence
level, and the router is pushed to distribute the token evenly within each
sequence. Under this strict constraint, even tokens from a domain-specific
sequence (e.g., code) are uniformly routed to all experts, thereby
inhibiting expert specialization. In this work, we propose calculating LBL
using a global-batch to loose this constraint. Because a
global-batch contains much more diverse sequences than a micro-batch, which
will encourage load balance at the corpus level. Specifically, we introduce an
extra communication step to synchronize f_i across micro-batches and then use
it to calculate the LBL. Through experiments on training MoEs-based LLMs (up to
42.8B total parameters and 400B tokens), we surprisingly
find that the global-batch LBL strategy yields excellent performance gains in
both pre-training perplexity and downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals that
the global-batch LBL also greatly improves the domain specialization of MoE
experts.

   ai_summary: Calculating Load-Balancing Loss using a global-batch instead of a micro-batch improves performance and domain specialization in MoE-based large language models.

   title: LlamaV-o1: Rethinking Step-by-step Visual Reasoning in LLMs
   summary: Reasoning is a fundamental capability for solving complex multi-step
problems, particularly in visual contexts where sequential step-wise
understanding is essential. Existing approaches lack a comprehensive framework
for evaluating visual reasoning and do not emphasize step-wise problem-solving.
To this end, we propose a comprehensive framework for advancing step-by-step
visual reasoning in large language models (LMMs) through three key
contributions. First, we introduce a visual reasoning benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate multi-step reasoning tasks. The benchmark presents a
diverse set of challenges with eight different categories ranging from complex
visual perception to scientific reasoning with over 4k reasoning steps in
total, enabling robust evaluation of LLMs' abilities to perform accurate and
interpretable visual reasoning across multiple steps. Second, we propose a
novel metric that assesses visual reasoning quality at the granularity of
individual steps, emphasizing both correctness and logical coherence. The
proposed metric offers deeper insights into reasoning performance compared to
traditional end-task accuracy metrics. Third, we present a new multimodal
visual reasoning model, named LlamaV-o1, trained using a multi-step curriculum
learning approach, where tasks are progressively organized to facilitate
incremental skill acquisition and problem-solving. The proposed LlamaV-o1 is
designed for multi-step reasoning and learns step-by-step through a structured
training paradigm. Extensive experiments show that our LlamaV-o1 outperforms
existing open-source models and performs favorably against close-source
proprietary models. Compared to the recent Llava-CoT, our LlamaV-o1 achieves an
average score of 67.3 with an absolute gain of 3.8\% across six benchmarks
while being 5 times faster during inference scaling. Our benchmark, model, and
code are publicly available.

   title: UI-TARS: Pioneering Automated GUI Interaction with Native Agents
   summary: This paper introduces UI-TARS, a native GUI agent model that solely perceives
the screenshots as input and performs human-like interactions (e.g., keyboard
and mouse operations). Unlike prevailing agent frameworks that depend on
heavily wrapped commercial models (e.g., GPT-4o) with expert-crafted prompts
and workflows, UI-TARS is an end-to-end model that outperforms these
sophisticated frameworks. Experiments demonstrate its superior performance:
UI-TARS achieves SOTA performance in 10+ GUI agent benchmarks evaluating
perception, grounding, and GUI task execution. Notably, in the OSWorld
benchmark, UI-TARS achieves scores of 24.6 with 50 steps and 22.7 with 15
steps, outperforming Claude (22.0 and 14.9 respectively). In AndroidWorld,
UI-TARS achieves 46.6, surpassing GPT-4o (34.5). UI-TARS incorporates several
key innovations: (1) Enhanced Perception: leveraging a large-scale dataset of
GUI screenshots for context-aware understanding of UI elements and precise
captioning; (2) Unified Action Modeling, which standardizes actions into a
unified space across platforms and achieves precise grounding and interaction
through large-scale action traces; (3) System-2 Reasoning, which incorporates
deliberate reasoning into multi-step decision making, involving multiple
reasoning patterns such as task decomposition, reflection thinking, milestone
recognition, etc. (4) Iterative Training with Reflective Online Traces, which
addresses the data bottleneck by automatically collecting, filtering, and
reflectively refining new interaction traces on hundreds of virtual machines.
Through iterative training and reflection tuning, UI-TARS continuously learns
from its mistakes and adapts to unforeseen situations with minimal human
intervention. We also analyze the evolution path of GUI agents to guide the
further development of this domain.

   title: Towards Best Practices for Open Datasets for LLM Training
   summary: Many AI companies are training their large language models (LLMs) on data
without the permission of the copyright owners. The permissibility of doing so
varies by jurisdiction: in countries like the EU and Japan, this is allowed
under certain restrictions, while in the United States, the legal landscape is
more ambiguous. Regardless of the legal status, concerns from creative
producers have led to several high-profile copyright lawsuits, and the threat
of litigation is commonly cited as a reason for the recent trend towards
minimizing the information shared about training datasets by both corporate and
public interest actors. This trend in limiting data information causes harm by
hindering transparency, accountability, and innovation in the broader ecosystem
by denying researchers, auditors, and impacted individuals access to the
information needed to understand AI models.
  While this could be mitigated by training language models on open access and
public domain data, at the time of writing, there are no such models (trained
at a meaningful scale) due to the substantial technical and sociological
challenges in assembling the necessary corpus. These challenges include
incomplete and unreliable metadata, the cost and complexity of digitizing
physical records, and the diverse set of legal and technical skills required to
ensure relevance and responsibility in a quickly changing landscape. Building
towards a future where AI systems can be trained on openly licensed data that
is responsibly curated and governed requires collaboration across legal,
technical, and policy domains, along with investments in metadata standards,
digitization, and fostering a culture of openness.

   title: Thoughts Are All Over the Place: On the Underthinking of o1-Like LLMs
   summary: Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's o1 have demonstrated remarkable
abilities in complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute and
exhibiting human-like deep thinking. However, we identify a phenomenon we term
underthinking, where o1-like LLMs frequently switch between different reasoning
thoughts without sufficiently exploring promising paths to reach a correct
solution. This behavior leads to inadequate depth of reasoning and decreased
performance, particularly on challenging mathematical problems. To
systematically analyze this issue, we conduct experiments on three challenging
test sets and two representative open-source o1-like models, revealing that
frequent thought switching correlates with incorrect responses. We introduce a
novel metric to quantify underthinking by measuring token efficiency in
incorrect answers. To address underthinking, we propose a decoding strategy
with thought switching penalty TIP that discourages premature transitions
between thoughts, encouraging deeper exploration of each reasoning path.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves accuracy across
challenging datasets without requiring model fine-tuning. Our findings
contribute to understanding reasoning inefficiencies in o1-like LLMs and offer
a practical solution to enhance their problem-solving capabilities.

   title: Test-Time Preference Optimization: On-the-Fly Alignment via Iterative
  Textual Feedback
   summary: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance but lack the
flexibility to adapt to human preferences quickly without retraining. In this
work, we introduce Test-time Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that
aligns LLM outputs with human preferences during inference, removing the need
to update model parameters. Rather than relying on purely numerical rewards,
TPO translates reward signals into textual critiques and uses them as textual
rewards to iteratively refine its response. Evaluations on benchmarks covering
instruction following, preference alignment, safety, and mathematics reveal
that TPO progressively improves alignment with human preferences. Notably,
after only a few TPO steps, the initially unaligned Llama-3.1-70B-SFT model can
surpass the aligned counterpart, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, TPO
scales efficiently with both the search width and depth during inference.
Through case studies, we illustrate how TPO exploits the innate capacity of LLM
to interpret and act upon reward signals. Our findings establish TPO as a
practical, lightweight alternative for test-time preference optimization,
achieving alignment on the fly. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/yafuly/TPO.

   ai_summary: TPO refines LLM outputs in real-time using textual critiques, achieving preference alignment without retraining.

   summary: Derived from diffusion models, MangaNinjia specializes in the task of
reference-guided line art colorization. We incorporate two thoughtful designs
to ensure precise character detail transcription, including a patch shuffling
module to facilitate correspondence learning between the reference color image
and the target line art, and a point-driven control scheme to enable
fine-grained color matching. Experiments on a self-collected benchmark
demonstrate the superiority of our model over current solutions in terms of
precise colorization. We further showcase the potential of the proposed
interactive point control in handling challenging cases, cross-character
colorization, multi-reference harmonization, beyond the reach of existing
algorithms.

   summary: We introduce Baichuan-Omni-1.5, an omni-modal model that not only has
omni-modal understanding capabilities but also provides end-to-end audio
generation capabilities. To achieve fluent and high-quality interaction across
modalities without compromising the capabilities of any modality, we
prioritized optimizing three key aspects. First, we establish a comprehensive
data cleaning and synthesis pipeline for multimodal data, obtaining about 500B
high-quality data (text, audio, and vision). Second, an audio-tokenizer
(Baichuan-Audio-Tokenizer) has been designed to capture both semantic and
acoustic information from audio, enabling seamless integration and enhanced
compatibility with MLLM. Lastly, we designed a multi-stage training strategy
that progressively integrates multimodal alignment and multitask fine-tuning,
ensuring effective synergy across all modalities. Baichuan-Omni-1.5 leads
contemporary models (including GPT4o-mini and MiniCPM-o 2.6) in terms of
comprehensive omni-modal capabilities. Notably, it achieves results comparable
to leading models such as Qwen2-VL-72B across various multimodal medical
benchmarks.

understanding, conversational coherence, and emotional intelligence in AI
systems. The study evaluates various approaches, including fine-tuning with
diverse datasets, incorporating psychological principles, and designing models
that better mimic human reasoning patterns. Our findings demonstrate that these
enhancements not only improve user interactions but also open new possibilities
for AI applications across different domains. Future work will address the
ethical implications and potential biases introduced by these human-like
attributes.

   title: Critique Fine-Tuning: Learning to Critique is More Effective than
  Learning to Imitate
   summary: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to train language models to
imitate annotated responses for given instructions. In this paper, we challenge
this paradigm and propose Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT), a strategy where models
learn to critique noisy responses rather than simply imitate correct ones.
Inspired by human learning processes that emphasize critical thinking, CFT
encourages deeper analysis and nuanced understanding-traits often overlooked by
standard SFT. To validate the effectiveness of CFT, we construct a 50K-sample
dataset from WebInstruct, using GPT-4o as the teacher to generate critiques in
the form of (input=[query; noisy response], output=critique). CFT on this
dataset yields a consistent 4-10% improvement over SFT on six math benchmarks
with different base models like Qwen2.5, Qwen2.5-Math and DeepSeek-Math. We
further expand to MetaMath and NuminaMath datasets and observe similar gains
over SFT. Notably, our Qwen2.5-Math-CFT model-trained on just 50K
samples-matches or outperforms competitive models such as AceMath and
Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct on most benchmarks, both of which use over 2M samples.
Ablation studies show that CFT is robust to the source of noisy response and
teacher critique model. Through these findings, we argue that critique-based
training offers a more effective alternative to advance the reasoning of
language models.

   title: Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation
   summary: This paper introduces an approach for training o1-like RAG models that
retrieve and reason over relevant information step by step before generating
the final answer. Conventional RAG methods usually perform a single retrieval
step before the generation process, which limits their effectiveness in
addressing complex queries due to imperfect retrieval results. In contrast, our
proposed method, CoRAG (Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation), allows the
model to dynamically reformulate the query based on the evolving state. To
train CoRAG effectively, we utilize rejection sampling to automatically
generate intermediate retrieval chains, thereby augmenting existing RAG
datasets that only provide the correct final answer. At test time, we propose
various decoding strategies to scale the model's test-time compute by
controlling the length and number of sampled retrieval chains. Experimental
results across multiple benchmarks validate the efficacy of CoRAG, particularly
in multi-hop question answering tasks, where we observe more than 10 points
improvement in EM score compared to strong baselines. On the KILT benchmark,
CoRAG establishes a new state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of
knowledge-intensive tasks. Furthermore, we offer comprehensive analyses to
understand the scaling behavior of CoRAG, laying the groundwork for future
research aimed at developing factual and grounded foundation models.

   title: OmniManip: Towards General Robotic Manipulation via Object-Centric
  Interaction Primitives as Spatial Constraints
   summary: The development of general robotic systems capable of manipulating in
unstructured environments is a significant challenge. While Vision-Language
Models(VLM) excel in high-level commonsense reasoning, they lack the
fine-grained 3D spatial understanding required for precise manipulation tasks.
Fine-tuning VLM on robotic datasets to create Vision-Language-Action
Models(VLA) is a potential solution, but it is hindered by high data collection
costs and generalization issues. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel object-centric representation that bridges the gap between VLM's
high-level reasoning and the low-level precision required for manipulation. Our
key insight is that an object's canonical space, defined by its functional
affordances, provides a structured and semantically meaningful way to describe
interaction primitives, such as points and directions. These primitives act as
a bridge, translating VLM's commonsense reasoning into actionable 3D spatial
constraints. In this context, we introduce a dual closed-loop, open-vocabulary
robotic manipulation system: one loop for high-level planning through primitive
resampling, interaction rendering and VLM checking, and another for low-level
execution via 6D pose tracking. This design ensures robust, real-time control
without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong
zero-shot generalization across diverse robotic manipulation tasks,
highlighting the potential of this approach for automating large-scale
simulation data generation.

   title: STAR: Spatial-Temporal Augmentation with Text-to-Video Models for
  Real-World Video Super-Resolution
   summary: Image diffusion models have been adapted for real-world video
super-resolution to tackle over-smoothing issues in GAN-based methods. However,
these models struggle to maintain temporal consistency, as they are trained on
static images, limiting their ability to capture temporal dynamics effectively.
Integrating text-to-video (T2V) models into video super-resolution for improved
temporal modeling is straightforward. However, two key challenges remain:
artifacts introduced by complex degradations in real-world scenarios, and
compromised fidelity due to the strong generative capacity of powerful T2V
models (e.g., CogVideoX-5B). To enhance the spatio-temporal quality of
restored videos, we introduce~\name
(Spatial-Temporal Augmentation with T2V models for
Real-world video super-resolution), a novel approach that leverages
T2V models for real-world video super-resolution, achieving realistic spatial
details and robust temporal consistency. Specifically, we introduce a Local
Information Enhancement Module (LIEM) before the global attention block to
enrich local details and mitigate degradation artifacts. Moreover, we propose a
Dynamic Frequency (DF) Loss to reinforce fidelity, guiding the model to focus
on different frequency components across diffusion steps. Extensive experiments
demonstrate~\name~outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

   title: BIOMEDICA: An Open Biomedical Image-Caption Archive, Dataset, and
  Vision-Language Models Derived from Scientific Literature
   summary: The development of vision-language models (VLMs) is driven by large-scale and
diverse multimodal datasets. However, progress toward generalist biomedical
VLMs is limited by the lack of annotated, publicly accessible datasets across
biology and medicine. Existing efforts are restricted to narrow domains,
missing the full diversity of biomedical knowledge encoded in scientific
literature. To address this gap, we introduce BIOMEDICA, a scalable,
open-source framework to extract, annotate, and serialize the entirety of the
PubMed Central Open Access subset into an easy-to-use, publicly accessible
dataset.Our framework produces a comprehensive archive with over 24 million
unique image-text pairs from over 6 million articles. Metadata and
expert-guided annotations are also provided. We demonstrate the utility and
accessibility of our resource by releasing BMCA-CLIP, a suite of CLIP-style
models continuously pre-trained on the BIOMEDICA dataset via streaming,
eliminating the need to download 27 TB of data locally.On average, our models
achieve state-of-the-art performance across 40 tasks - spanning pathology,
radiology, ophthalmology, dermatology, surgery, molecular biology,
parasitology, and cell biology - excelling in zero-shot classification with a
6.56% average improvement (as high as 29.8% and 17.5% in dermatology and
ophthalmology, respectively), and stronger image-text retrieval, all while
using 10x less compute. To foster reproducibility and collaboration, we release
our codebase and dataset for the broader research community.

   title: EnerVerse: Envisioning Embodied Future Space for Robotics Manipulation
   summary: We introduce EnerVerse, a comprehensive framework for embodied future space
generation specifically designed for robotic manipulation tasks. EnerVerse
seamlessly integrates convolutional and bidirectional attention mechanisms for
inner-chunk space modeling, ensuring low-level consistency and continuity.
Recognizing the inherent redundancy in video data, we propose a sparse memory
context combined with a chunkwise unidirectional generative paradigm to enable
the generation of infinitely long sequences. To further augment robotic
capabilities, we introduce the Free Anchor View (FAV) space, which provides
flexible perspectives to enhance observation and analysis. The FAV space
mitigates motion modeling ambiguity, removes physical constraints in confined
environments, and significantly improves the robot's generalization and
adaptability across various tasks and settings. To address the prohibitive
costs and labor intensity of acquiring multi-camera observations, we present a
data engine pipeline that integrates a generative model with 4D Gaussian
Splatting (4DGS). This pipeline leverages the generative model's robust
generalization capabilities and the spatial constraints provided by 4DGS,
enabling an iterative enhancement of data quality and diversity, thus creating
a data flywheel effect that effectively narrows the sim-to-real gap. Finally,
our experiments demonstrate that the embodied future space generation prior
substantially enhances policy predictive capabilities, resulting in improved
overall performance, particularly in long-range robotic manipulation tasks.

   title: PaSa: An LLM Agent for Comprehensive Academic Paper Search
   summary: We introduce PaSa, an advanced Paper Search agent powered by large language
models. PaSa can autonomously make a series of decisions, including invoking
search tools, reading papers, and selecting relevant references, to ultimately
obtain comprehensive and accurate results for complex scholarly queries. We
optimize PaSa using reinforcement learning with a synthetic dataset,
AutoScholarQuery, which includes 35k fine-grained academic queries and
corresponding papers sourced from top-tier AI conference publications.
Additionally, we develop RealScholarQuery, a benchmark collecting real-world
academic queries to assess PaSa performance in more realistic scenarios.

   title: Transformer^2: Self-adaptive LLMs
   summary: Self-adaptive large language models (LLMs) aim to solve the challenges posed
by traditional fine-tuning methods, which are often computationally intensive
and static in their ability to handle diverse tasks. We introduce \implname, a
novel self-adaptation framework that adapts LLMs for unseen tasks in real-time
by selectively adjusting only the singular components of their weight matrices.
During inference, \implname employs a two-pass mechanism: first, a dispatch
system identifies the task properties, and then task-specific "expert" vectors,
trained using reinforcement learning, are dynamically mixed to obtain targeted
behavior for the incoming prompt. Our method outperforms ubiquitous approaches
such as LoRA, with fewer parameters and greater efficiency. \implname
demonstrates versatility across different LLM architectures and modalities,
including vision-language tasks. \implname represents a significant leap
forward, offering a scalable, efficient solution for enhancing the adaptability
and task-specific performance of LLMs, paving the way for truly dynamic,
self-organizing AI systems.

   title: VideoAnydoor: High-fidelity Video Object Insertion with Precise Motion
  Control
   summary: Despite significant advancements in video generation, inserting a given
object into videos remains a challenging task. The difficulty lies in
preserving the appearance details of the reference object and accurately
modeling coherent motions at the same time. In this paper, we propose
VideoAnydoor, a zero-shot video object insertion framework with high-fidelity
detail preservation and precise motion control. Starting from a text-to-video
model, we utilize an ID extractor to inject the global identity and leverage a
box sequence to control the overall motion. To preserve the detailed appearance
and meanwhile support fine-grained motion control, we design a pixel warper. It
takes the reference image with arbitrary key-points and the corresponding
key-point trajectories as inputs. It warps the pixel details according to the
trajectories and fuses the warped features with the diffusion U-Net, thus
improving detail preservation and supporting users in manipulating the motion
trajectories. In addition, we propose a training strategy involving both videos
and static images with a reweight reconstruction loss to enhance insertion
quality. VideoAnydoor demonstrates significant superiority over existing
methods and naturally supports various downstream applications (e.g., talking
head generation, video virtual try-on, multi-region editing) without
task-specific fine-tuning.
   id: 2501.01427

   title: MinMo: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Seamless Voice Interaction
   summary: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal
speech-text models have laid the groundwork for seamless voice interactions,
enabling real-time, natural, and human-like conversations. Previous models for
voice interactions are categorized as native and aligned. Native models
integrate speech and text processing in one framework but struggle with issues
like differing sequence lengths and insufficient pre-training. Aligned models
maintain text LLM capabilities but are often limited by small datasets and a
narrow focus on speech tasks. In this work, we introduce MinMo, a Multimodal
Large Language Model with approximately 8B parameters for seamless voice
interaction. We address the main limitations of prior aligned multimodal
models. We train MinMo through multiple stages of speech-to-text alignment,
text-to-speech alignment, speech-to-speech alignment, and duplex interaction
alignment, on 1.4 million hours of diverse speech data and a broad range of
speech tasks. After the multi-stage training, MinMo achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various benchmarks for voice comprehension and generation
while maintaining the capabilities of text LLMs, and also facilitates
full-duplex conversation, that is, simultaneous two-way communication between
the user and the system. Moreover, we propose a novel and simple voice decoder
that outperforms prior models in voice generation. The enhanced
instruction-following capabilities of MinMo supports controlling speech
generation based on user instructions, with various nuances including emotions,
dialects, and speaking rates, and mimicking specific voices. For MinMo, the
speech-to-text latency is approximately 100ms, full-duplex latency is
approximately 600ms in theory and 800ms in practice. The MinMo project web page
is https://funaudiollm.github.io/minmo, and the code and models will be
released soon.

   title: LLaVA-Mini: Efficient Image and Video Large Multimodal Models with One
  Vision Token
   summary: The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has
sparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs. LMM frameworks typically
encode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and
integrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language
models (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens
(predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead.
Previous efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM
backbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token
quantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal
vision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while
preserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision
tokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early
layers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text
tokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to
fuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the
extreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token.
LLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the
understanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient
manner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks
demonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token
instead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by
77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over
10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory.
   id: 2501.03895
   ai_summary: LLaVA-Mini, a unified large multimodal model, significantly reduces computational cost and latency by compressing vision tokens to a single token before feeding them to the LLM backbone, outperforming previous models.

   title: CodeElo: Benchmarking Competition-level Code Generation of LLMs with
  Human-comparable Elo Ratings
   summary: With the increasing code reasoning capabilities of existing large language
models (LLMs) and breakthroughs in reasoning models like OpenAI o1 and o3,
there is a growing need to develop more challenging and comprehensive
benchmarks that effectively test their sophisticated competition-level coding
abilities. Existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and USACO, fall short due to
the unavailability of private test cases, lack of support for special judges,
and misaligned execution environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CodeElo, a standardized competition-level code generation benchmark that
effectively addresses all these challenges for the first time. CodeElo
benchmark is mainly based on the official CodeForces platform and tries to
align with the platform as much as possible. We compile the recent six months
of contest problems on CodeForces with detailed information such as contest
divisions, problem difficulty ratings, and problem algorithm tags. We introduce
a unique judging method in which problems are submitted directly to the
platform and develop a reliable Elo rating calculation system that aligns with
the platform and is comparable with human participants but has lower variance.
By testing on our CodeElo, we provide the Elo ratings of 30 existing popular
open-source and 3 proprietary LLMs for the first time. The results show that
o1-mini and QwQ-32B-Preview stand out significantly, achieving Elo ratings of
1578 and 1261, respectively, while other models struggle even with the easiest
problems, placing in the lowest 20 percent among all human participants.
Detailed analysis experiments are also conducted to provide insights into
performance across algorithms and comparisons between using C++ and Python,
which can suggest directions for future studies.

   title: LTX-Video: Realtime Video Latent Diffusion
   summary: We introduce LTX-Video, a transformer-based latent diffusion model that
adopts a holistic approach to video generation by seamlessly integrating the
responsibilities of the Video-VAE and the denoising transformer. Unlike
existing methods, which treat these components as independent, LTX-Video aims
to optimize their interaction for improved efficiency and quality. At its core
is a carefully designed Video-VAE that achieves a high compression ratio of
1:192, with spatiotemporal downscaling of 32 x 32 x 8 pixels per token, enabled
by relocating the patchifying operation from the transformer's input to the
VAE's input. Operating in this highly compressed latent space enables the
transformer to efficiently perform full spatiotemporal self-attention, which is
essential for generating high-resolution videos with temporal consistency.
However, the high compression inherently limits the representation of fine
details. To address this, our VAE decoder is tasked with both latent-to-pixel
conversion and the final denoising step, producing the clean result directly in
pixel space. This approach preserves the ability to generate fine details
without incurring the runtime cost of a separate upsampling module. Our model
supports diverse use cases, including text-to-video and image-to-video
generation, with both capabilities trained simultaneously. It achieves
faster-than-real-time generation, producing 5 seconds of 24 fps video at
768x512 resolution in just 2 seconds on an Nvidia H100 GPU, outperforming all
existing models of similar scale. The source code and pre-trained models are
publicly available, setting a new benchmark for accessible and scalable video
generation.

   title: Hunyuan3D 2.0: Scaling Diffusion Models for High Resolution Textured 3D
  Assets Generation
   summary: We present Hunyuan3D 2.0, an advanced large-scale 3D synthesis system for
generating high-resolution textured 3D assets. This system includes two
foundation components: a large-scale shape generation model -- Hunyuan3D-DiT,
and a large-scale texture synthesis model -- Hunyuan3D-Paint. The shape
generative model, built on a scalable flow-based diffusion transformer, aims to
create geometry that properly aligns with a given condition image, laying a
solid foundation for downstream applications. The texture synthesis model,
benefiting from strong geometric and diffusion priors, produces high-resolution
and vibrant texture maps for either generated or hand-crafted meshes.
Furthermore, we build Hunyuan3D-Studio -- a versatile, user-friendly production
platform that simplifies the re-creation process of 3D assets. It allows both
professional and amateur users to manipulate or even animate their meshes
efficiently. We systematically evaluate our models, showing that Hunyuan3D 2.0
outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including the open-source models
and closed-source models in geometry details, condition alignment, texture
quality, and etc. Hunyuan3D 2.0 is publicly released in order to fill the gaps
in the open-source 3D community for large-scale foundation generative models.
The code and pre-trained weights of our models are available at:

   title: SmolLM2: When Smol Goes Big -- Data-Centric Training of a Small Language Model
   summary: While large language models have facilitated breakthroughs in many applications of artificial intelligence, their inherent largeness makes them computationally expensive and challenging to deploy in resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we document the development of SmolLM2, a state-of-the-art "small" (1.7 billion parameter) language model (LM). To attain strong performance, we overtrain SmolLM2 on ~11 trillion tokens of data using a multi-stage training process that mixes web text with specialized math, code, and instruction-following data. We additionally introduce new specialized datasets (FineMath, Stack-Edu, and SmolTalk) at stages where we found existing datasets to be problematically small or low-quality. To inform our design decisions, we perform both small-scale ablations as well as a manual refinement process that updates the dataset mixing rates at each stage based on the performance at the previous stage. Ultimately, we demonstrate that SmolLM2 outperforms other recent small LMs including Qwen2.5-1.5B and Llama3.2-1B. To facilitate future research on LM development as well as applications of small LMs, we release both SmolLM2 as well as all of the datasets we prepared in the course of this project.

   title: OmniHuman-1: Rethinking the Scaling-Up of One-Stage Conditioned Human
  Animation Models
   summary: End-to-end human animation, such as audio-driven talking human generation,
has undergone notable advancements in the recent few years. However, existing
methods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models,
limiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose
OmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by
mixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we
introduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the
corresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable
OmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving
highly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports
various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body),
supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and
challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to
existing end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more
realistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also
supports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined
driving signals). Video samples are provided on the ttfamily project page

   title: Qwen2.5-VL Technical Report
   summary: We introduce Qwen2.5-VL, the latest flagship model of Qwen vision-language
series, which demonstrates significant advancements in both foundational
capabilities and innovative functionalities. Qwen2.5-VL achieves a major leap
forward in understanding and interacting with the world through enhanced visual
recognition, precise object localization, robust document parsing, and
long-video comprehension. A standout feature of Qwen2.5-VL is its ability to
localize objects using bounding boxes or points accurately. It provides robust
structured data extraction from invoices, forms, and tables, as well as
detailed analysis of charts, diagrams, and layouts. To handle complex inputs,
Qwen2.5-VL introduces dynamic resolution processing and absolute time encoding,
enabling it to process images of varying sizes and videos of extended durations
(up to hours) with second-level event localization. This allows the model to
natively perceive spatial scales and temporal dynamics without relying on
traditional normalization techniques. By training a native dynamic-resolution
Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch and incorporating Window Attention, we
reduce computational overhead while maintaining native resolution. As a result,
Qwen2.5-VL excels not only in static image and document understanding but also
as an interactive visual agent capable of reasoning, tool usage, and task
execution in real-world scenarios such as operating computers and mobile
devices. Qwen2.5-VL is available in three sizes, addressing diverse use cases
from edge AI to high-performance computing. The flagship Qwen2.5-VL-72B model
matches state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, particularly
excelling in document and diagram understanding. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL
maintains robust linguistic performance, preserving the core language
competencies of the Qwen2.5 LLM.

   title: MLGym: A New Framework and Benchmark for Advancing AI Research Agents
   summary: We introduce Meta MLGym and MLGym-Bench, a new framework and benchmark for
evaluating and developing LLM agents on AI research tasks. This is the first
Gym environment for machine learning (ML) tasks, enabling research on
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for training such agents. MLGym-bench
consists of 13 diverse and open-ended AI research tasks from diverse domains
such as computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning,
and game theory. Solving these tasks requires real-world AI research skills
such as generating new ideas and hypotheses, creating and processing data,
implementing ML methods, training models, running experiments, analyzing the
results, and iterating through this process to improve on a given task. We
evaluate a number of frontier large language models (LLMs) on our benchmarks
such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1 405B, GPT-4o, o1-preview, and Gemini-1.5
Pro. Our MLGym framework makes it easy to add new tasks, integrate and evaluate
models or agents, generate synthetic data at scale, as well as develop new
learning algorithms for training agents on AI research tasks. We find that
current frontier models can improve on the given baselines, usually by finding
better hyperparameters, but do not generate novel hypotheses, algorithms,
architectures, or substantial improvements. We open-source our framework and
benchmark to facilitate future research in advancing the AI research
capabilities of LLM agents.

   title: The Stochastic Parrot on LLM's Shoulder: A Summative Assessment of
  Physical Concept Understanding
   summary: In a systematic way, we investigate a widely asked question: Do LLMs really
understand what they say?, which relates to the more familiar term Stochastic
Parrot. To this end, we propose a summative assessment over a carefully
designed physical concept understanding task, PhysiCo. Our task alleviates the
memorization issue via the usage of grid-format inputs that abstractly describe
physical phenomena. The grids represents varying levels of understanding, from
the core phenomenon, application examples to analogies to other abstract
patterns in the grid world. A comprehensive study on our task demonstrates: (1)
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, o1 and Gemini 2.0 flash thinking, lag
behind humans by ~40%; (2) the stochastic parrot phenomenon is present in LLMs,
as they fail on our grid task but can describe and recognize the same concepts
well in natural language; (3) our task challenges the LLMs due to intrinsic
difficulties rather than the unfamiliar grid format, as in-context learning and
fine-tuning on same formatted data added little to their performance.

   title: LLM-Microscope: Uncovering the Hidden Role of Punctuation in Context
  Memory of Transformers
   summary: We introduce methods to quantify how Large Language Models (LLMs) encode and
store contextual information, revealing that tokens often seen as minor (e.g.,
determiners, punctuation) carry surprisingly high context. Notably, removing
these tokens -- especially stopwords, articles, and commas -- consistently
degrades performance on MMLU and BABILong-4k, even if removing only irrelevant
tokens. Our analysis also shows a strong correlation between contextualization
and linearity, where linearity measures how closely the transformation from one
layer's embeddings to the next can be approximated by a single linear mapping.
These findings underscore the hidden importance of filler tokens in maintaining
context. For further exploration, we present LLM-Microscope, an open-source
toolkit that assesses token-level nonlinearity, evaluates contextual memory,
visualizes intermediate layer contributions (via an adapted Logit Lens), and
measures the intrinsic dimensionality of representations. This toolkit
illuminates how seemingly trivial tokens can be critical for long-range
understanding.

   title: Native Sparse Attention: Hardware-Aligned and Natively Trainable Sparse
  Attention
   summary: Long-context modeling is crucial for next-generation language models, yet the
high computational cost of standard attention mechanisms poses significant
computational challenges. Sparse attention offers a promising direction for
improving efficiency while maintaining model capabilities. We present NSA, a
Natively trainable Sparse Attention mechanism that integrates algorithmic
innovations with hardware-aligned optimizations to achieve efficient
long-context modeling. NSA employs a dynamic hierarchical sparse strategy,
combining coarse-grained token compression with fine-grained token selection to
preserve both global context awareness and local precision. Our approach
advances sparse attention design with two key innovations: (1) We achieve
substantial speedups through arithmetic intensity-balanced algorithm design,
with implementation optimizations for modern hardware. (2) We enable end-to-end
training, reducing pretraining computation without sacrificing model
performance. As shown in Figure 1, experiments show the model pretrained with
NSA maintains or exceeds Full Attention models across general benchmarks,
long-context tasks, and instruction-based reasoning. Meanwhile, NSA achieves
substantial speedups over Full Attention on 64k-length sequences across
decoding, forward propagation, and backward propagation, validating its
efficiency throughout the model lifecycle.

   title: SigLIP 2: Multilingual Vision-Language Encoders with Improved Semantic
  Understanding, Localization, and Dense Features
   summary: We introduce SigLIP 2, a family of new multilingual vision-language encoders
that build on the success of the original SigLIP. In this second iteration, we
extend the original image-text training objective with several prior,
independently developed techniques into a unified recipe -- this includes
captioning-based pretraining, self-supervised losses (self-distillation, masked
prediction) and online data curation. With these changes, SigLIP 2 models
outperform their SigLIP counterparts at all model scales in core capabilities,
including zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and transfer
performance when extracting visual representations for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). Furthermore, the new training recipe leads to significant improvements
on localization and dense prediction tasks. We also train variants which
support multiple resolutions and preserve the input's native aspect ratio.
Finally, we train on a more diverse data-mixture that includes de-biasing
techniques, leading to much better multilingual understanding and improved
fairness. To allow users to trade off inference cost with performance, we
release model checkpoints at four sizes: ViT-B (86M), L (303M), So400m (400M),
and g (1B).

   title: Can 1B LLM Surpass 405B LLM? Rethinking Compute-Optimal Test-Time
  Scaling
   summary: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is an important method for improving the performance
of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional computation during the
inference phase. However, current studies do not systematically analyze how
policy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulty influence
TTS. This lack of analysis limits the understanding and practical use of TTS
methods. In this paper, we focus on two core questions: (1) What is the optimal
approach to scale test-time computation across different policy models, PRMs,
and problem difficulty levels? (2) To what extent can extended computation
improve the performance of LLMs on complex tasks, and can smaller language
models outperform larger ones through this approach? Through comprehensive
experiments on MATH-500 and challenging AIME24 tasks, we have the following
observations: (1) The compute-optimal TTS strategy is highly dependent on the
choice of policy model, PRM, and problem difficulty. (2) With our
compute-optimal TTS strategy, extremely small policy models can outperform
larger models. For example, a 1B LLM can exceed a 405B LLM on MATH-500.
Moreover, on both MATH-500 and AIME24, a 0.5B LLM outperforms GPT-4o, a 3B LLM
surpasses a 405B LLM, and a 7B LLM beats o1 and DeepSeek-R1, while with higher
inference efficiency. These findings show the significance of adapting TTS
strategies to the specific characteristics of each task and model and indicate
that TTS is a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.

   title: Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning: A Recurrent Depth
  Approach
   summary: We study a novel language model architecture that is capable of scaling
test-time computation by implicitly reasoning in latent space. Our model works
by iterating a recurrent block, thereby unrolling to arbitrary depth at
test-time. This stands in contrast to mainstream reasoning models that scale up
compute by producing more tokens. Unlike approaches based on chain-of-thought,
our approach does not require any specialized training data, can work with
small context windows, and can capture types of reasoning that are not easily
represented in words. We scale a proof-of-concept model to 3.5 billion
parameters and 800 billion tokens. We show that the resulting model can improve
its performance on reasoning benchmarks, sometimes dramatically, up to a
computation load equivalent to 50 billion parameters.

   title: InfiniteHiP: Extending Language Model Context Up to 3 Million Tokens on
  a Single GPU
   summary: In modern large language models (LLMs), handling very long context lengths
presents significant challenges as it causes slower inference speeds and
increased memory costs. Additionally, most existing pre-trained LLMs fail to
generalize beyond their original training sequence lengths. To enable efficient
and practical long-context utilization, we introduce InfiniteHiP, a novel, and
practical LLM inference framework that accelerates processing by dynamically
eliminating irrelevant context tokens through a modular hierarchical token
pruning algorithm. Our method also allows generalization to longer sequences by
selectively applying various RoPE adjustment methods according to the internal
attention patterns within LLMs. Furthermore, we offload the key-value cache to
host memory during inference, significantly reducing GPU memory pressure. As a
result, InfiniteHiP enables the processing of up to 3 million tokens on a
single L40s 48GB GPU -- 3x larger -- without any permanent loss of context
information. Our framework achieves an 18.95x speedup in attention decoding for
a 1 million token context without requiring additional training. We implement
our method in the SGLang framework and demonstrate its effectiveness and
practicality through extensive evaluations.

   title: Expect the Unexpected: FailSafe Long Context QA for Finance
   summary: We propose a new long-context financial benchmark, FailSafeQA, designed to
test the robustness and context-awareness of LLMs against six variations in
human-interface interactions in LLM-based query-answer systems within finance.
We concentrate on two case studies: Query Failure and Context Failure. In the
Query Failure scenario, we perturb the original query to vary in domain
expertise, completeness, and linguistic accuracy. In the Context Failure case,
we simulate the uploads of degraded, irrelevant, and empty documents. We employ
the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and use fine-grained
rating criteria to define and calculate Robustness, Context Grounding, and
Compliance scores for 24 off-the-shelf models. The results suggest that
although some models excel at mitigating input perturbations, they must balance
robust answering with the ability to refrain from hallucinating. Notably,
Palmyra-Fin-128k-Instruct, recognized as the most compliant model, maintained
strong baseline performance but encountered challenges in sustaining robust
predictions in 17% of test cases. On the other hand, the most robust model,
OpenAI o3-mini, fabricated information in 41% of tested cases. The results
demonstrate that even high-performing models have significant room for
improvement and highlight the role of FailSafeQA as a tool for developing LLMs
optimized for dependability in financial applications. The dataset is available

   title: Large Language Diffusion Models
   summary: Autoregressive models (ARMs) are widely regarded as the cornerstone of large
language models (LLMs). We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a
diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA models distributions through a forward data
masking process and a reverse process, parameterized by a vanilla Transformer
to predict masked tokens. By optimizing a likelihood bound, it provides a
principled generative approach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive
benchmarks, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability, outperforming our
self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong
LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive
instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue.
Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal
poem completion task. Our findings establish diffusion models as a viable and
promising alternative to ARMs, challenging the assumption that key LLM

   title: s1: Simple test-time scaling
   summary: Test-time scaling is a promising new approach to language modeling that uses
extra test-time compute to improve performance. Recently, OpenAI's o1 model
showed this capability but did not publicly share its methodology, leading to
many replication efforts. We seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time
scaling and strong reasoning performance. First, we curate a small dataset s1K
of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we
validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we
develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating
the model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending "Wait" multiple
times to the model's generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model
to double-check its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps. After
supervised finetuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on s1K and
equipping it with budget forcing, our model s1 exceeds o1-preview on
competition math questions by up to 27% (MATH and AIME24). Further, scaling s1
with budget forcing allows extrapolating beyond its performance without
test-time intervention: from 50% to 57% on AIME24. Our model, data, and code
are open-source at https://github.com/simplescaling/s1.

   ai_summary: The use of budget forcing during test time improves reasoning performance in language models, as demonstrated by the s1 model which outperforms the o1-preview on competition math questions.

   title: The Differences Between Direct Alignment Algorithms are a Blur
   summary: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) simplify language model alignment by
replacing reinforcement learning (RL) and reward modeling (RM) in Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with direct policy optimization. DAAs can
be classified by their ranking losses (pairwise vs. pointwise), by the rewards
used in those losses (e.g., likelihood ratios of policy and reference policy,
or odds ratios), or by whether a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase is required
(two-stage vs. one-stage). We first show that one-stage methods underperform
two-stage methods. To address this, we incorporate an explicit SFT phase and
introduce the beta parameter, controlling the strength of preference
optimization, into single-stage ORPO and ASFT. These modifications improve
their performance in Alpaca Eval 2 by +3.46 (ORPO) and +8.27 (ASFT),
matching two-stage methods like DPO. Further analysis reveals that the key
factor is whether the approach uses pairwise or pointwise objectives, rather
than the specific implicit reward or loss function. These results highlight the
importance of careful evaluation to avoid premature claims of performance gains
or overall superiority in alignment algorithms.
   id: 2502.01237
   ai_summary: Direct Alignment Algorithms improve language model alignment by introducing a supervised fine-tuning phase and adjusting preference optimization strength, showing that ranking objectives are crucial for performance.

   title: SuperGPQA: Scaling LLM Evaluation across 285 Graduate Disciplines
   summary: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
mainstream academic disciplines such as mathematics, physics, and computer
science. However, human knowledge encompasses over 200 specialized disciplines,
far exceeding the scope of existing benchmarks. The capabilities of LLMs in
many of these specialized fields-particularly in light industry, agriculture,
and service-oriented disciplines-remain inadequately evaluated. To address this
gap, we present SuperGPQA, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates
graduate-level knowledge and reasoning capabilities across 285 disciplines. Our
benchmark employs a novel Human-LLM collaborative filtering mechanism to
eliminate trivial or ambiguous questions through iterative refinement based on
both LLM responses and expert feedback. Our experimental results reveal
significant room for improvement in the performance of current state-of-the-art
LLMs across diverse knowledge domains (e.g., the reasoning-focused model
DeepSeek-R1 achieved the highest accuracy of 61.82% on SuperGPQA), highlighting
the considerable gap between current model capabilities and artificial general
intelligence. Additionally, we present comprehensive insights from our
management of a large-scale annotation process, involving over 80 expert
annotators and an interactive Human-LLM collaborative system, offering valuable
methodological guidance for future research initiatives of comparable scope.

   title: SurveyX: Academic Survey Automation via Large Language Models
   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional comprehension
capabilities and a vast knowledge base, suggesting that LLMs can serve as
efficient tools for automated survey generation. However, recent research
related to automated survey generation remains constrained by some critical
limitations like finite context window, lack of in-depth content discussion,
and absence of systematic evaluation frameworks. Inspired by human writing
processes, we propose SurveyX, an efficient and organized system for automated
survey generation that decomposes the survey composing process into two phases:
the Preparation and Generation phases. By innovatively introducing online
reference retrieval, a pre-processing method called AttributeTree, and a
re-polishing process, SurveyX significantly enhances the efficacy of survey
composition. Experimental evaluation results show that SurveyX outperforms
existing automated survey generation systems in content quality (0.259
improvement) and citation quality (1.76 enhancement), approaching human expert
performance across multiple evaluation dimensions. Examples of surveys
generated by SurveyX are available on www.surveyx.cn

   title: How Much Knowledge Can You Pack into a LoRA Adapter without Harming LLM?
   summary: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on many tasks is greatly
limited by the knowledge learned during pre-training and stored in the model's
parameters. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a popular and efficient training
technique for updating or domain-specific adaptation of LLMs. In this study, we
investigate how new facts can be incorporated into the LLM using LoRA without
compromising the previously learned knowledge. We fine-tuned
Llama-3.1-8B-instruct using LoRA with varying amounts of new knowledge. Our
experiments have shown that the best results are obtained when the training
data contains a mixture of known and new facts. However, this approach is still
potentially harmful because the model's performance on external
question-answering benchmarks declines after such fine-tuning. When the
training data is biased towards certain entities, the model tends to regress to
few overrepresented answers. In addition, we found that the model becomes more
confident and refuses to provide an answer in only few cases. These findings
highlight the potential pitfalls of LoRA-based LLM updates and underscore the
importance of training data composition and tuning parameters to balance new
knowledge integration and general model capabilities.
   id: 2502.14502
   ai_summary: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively updates LLMs with new knowledge but risks degrading performance on external benchmarks due to data bias and overconfidence.

   title: SynthDetoxM: Modern LLMs are Few-Shot Parallel Detoxification Data
  Annotators
   summary: Existing approaches to multilingual text detoxification are hampered by the
scarcity of parallel multilingual datasets. In this work, we introduce a
pipeline for the generation of multilingual parallel detoxification data. We
also introduce SynthDetoxM, a manually collected and synthetically generated
multilingual parallel text detoxification dataset comprising 16,000
high-quality detoxification sentence pairs across German, French, Spanish and
Russian. The data was sourced from different toxicity evaluation datasets and
then rewritten with nine modern open-source LLMs in few-shot setting. Our
experiments demonstrate that models trained on the produced synthetic datasets
have superior performance to those trained on the human-annotated
MultiParaDetox dataset even in data limited setting. Models trained on
SynthDetoxM outperform all evaluated LLMs in few-shot setting. We release our
dataset and code to help further research in multilingual text detoxification.

   title: Soundwave: Less is More for Speech-Text Alignment in LLMs
   summary: Existing end-to-end speech large language models (LLMs) usually rely on
large-scale annotated data for training, while data-efficient training has not
been discussed in depth. We focus on two fundamental problems between speech
and text: the representation space gap and sequence length inconsistency. We
propose Soundwave, which utilizes an efficient training strategy and a novel
architecture to address these issues. Results show that Soundwave outperforms
the advanced Qwen2-Audio in speech translation and AIR-Bench speech tasks,
using only one-fiftieth of the training data. Further analysis shows that
Soundwave still retains its intelligence during conversation. The project is
available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/Soundwave.
   id: 2502.12900
   ai_summary: Soundwave addresses the representation space gap and sequence length inconsistency in end-to-end speech large language models using an efficient training strategy and novel architecture, outperforming Qwen2-Audio with significantly less data.

   title: Self-rewarding correction for mathematical reasoning
   summary: We study self-rewarding reasoning large language models (LLMs), which can
simultaneously generate step-by-step reasoning and evaluate the correctness of
their outputs during the inference time-without external feedback. This
integrated approach allows a single model to independently guide its reasoning
process, offering computational advantages for model deployment. We
particularly focus on the representative task of self-correction, where models
autonomously detect errors in their responses, revise outputs, and decide when
to terminate iterative refinement loops. To enable this, we propose a
two-staged algorithmic framework for constructing self-rewarding reasoning
models using only self-generated data. In the first stage, we employ sequential
rejection sampling to synthesize long chain-of-thought trajectories that
incorporate both self-rewarding and self-correction mechanisms. Fine-tuning
models on these curated data allows them to learn the patterns of
self-rewarding and self-correction. In the second stage, we further enhance the
models' ability to assess response accuracy and refine outputs through
reinforcement learning with rule-based signals. Experiments with Llama-3 and
Qwen-2.5 demonstrate that our approach surpasses intrinsic self-correction
capabilities and achieves performance comparable to systems that rely on
external reward models.

   title: VideoGrain: Modulating Space-Time Attention for Multi-grained Video
  Editing
   summary: Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video
generation and editing capabilities. However, multi-grained video editing,
which encompasses class-level, instance-level, and part-level modifications,
remains a formidable challenge. The major difficulties in multi-grained editing
include semantic misalignment of text-to-region control and feature coupling
within the diffusion model. To address these difficulties, we present
VideoGrain, a zero-shot approach that modulates space-time (cross- and self-)
attention mechanisms to achieve fine-grained control over video content. We
enhance text-to-region control by amplifying each local prompt's attention to
its corresponding spatial-disentangled region while minimizing interactions
with irrelevant areas in cross-attention. Additionally, we improve feature
separation by increasing intra-region awareness and reducing inter-region
interference in self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world scenarios. Our code, data,
and demos are available at https://knightyxp.github.io/VideoGrain_project_page/

   title: SWE-RL: Advancing LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning on Open
  Software Evolution
   summary: The recent DeepSeek-R1 release has demonstrated the immense potential of
reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of
large language models (LLMs). While DeepSeek-R1 and other follow-up work
primarily focus on applying RL to competitive coding and math problems, this
paper introduces SWE-RL, the first approach to scale RL-based LLM reasoning for
real-world software engineering. Leveraging a lightweight rule-based reward
(e.g., the similarity score between ground-truth and LLM-generated solutions),
SWE-RL enables LLMs to autonomously recover a developer's reasoning processes
and solutions by learning from extensive open-source software evolution data --
the record of a software's entire lifecycle, including its code snapshots, code
changes, and events such as issues and pull requests. Trained on top of Llama
3, our resulting reasoning model, Llama3-SWE-RL-70B, achieves a 41.0% solve
rate on SWE-bench Verified -- a human-verified collection of real-world GitHub
issues. To our knowledge, this is the best performance reported for
medium-sized (<100B) LLMs to date, even comparable to leading proprietary LLMs
like GPT-4o. Surprisingly, despite performing RL solely on software evolution
data, Llama3-SWE-RL has even emerged with generalized reasoning skills. For
example, it shows improved results on five out-of-domain tasks, namely,
function coding, library use, code reasoning, mathematics, and general language
understanding, whereas a supervised-finetuning baseline even leads to
performance degradation on average. Overall, SWE-RL opens up a new direction to
improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through reinforcement learning on
massive software engineering data.
   id: 2502.18449

   title: OmniAlign-V: Towards Enhanced Alignment of MLLMs with Human Preference
   summary: Recent advancements in open-source multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
have primarily focused on enhancing foundational capabilities, leaving a
significant gap in human preference alignment. This paper introduces
OmniAlign-V, a comprehensive dataset of 200K high-quality training samples
featuring diverse images, complex questions, and varied response formats to
improve MLLMs' alignment with human preferences. We also present MM-AlignBench,
a human-annotated benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MLLMs' alignment
with human values. Experimental results show that finetuning MLLMs with
OmniAlign-V, using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), significantly enhances human preference alignment while
maintaining or enhancing performance on standard VQA benchmarks, preserving
their fundamental capabilities. Our datasets, benchmark, code and checkpoints
have been released at https://github.com/PhoenixZ810/OmniAlign-V.

   title: Cramming 1568 Tokens into a Single Vector and Back Again: Exploring the
  Limits of Embedding Space Capacity
   summary: A range of recent works addresses the problem of compression of sequence of
tokens into a shorter sequence of real-valued vectors to be used as inputs
instead of token embeddings or key-value cache. These approaches allow to
reduce the amount of compute in existing language models. Despite relying on
powerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio
is typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in
theory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far
beyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size.
In this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder
with a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression
ratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between
existing and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show
that the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but
by the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on
this sequence without any conditioning. The obtained limits highlight the
substantial gap between the theoretical capacity of input embeddings and their
practical utilization, suggesting significant room for optimization in model
design.
   id: 2502.13063
   ai_summary: Using per-sample optimization, compression ratios of up to x1500 are achieved for sequence-to-vector compression in language models, highlighting a large gap between theoretical and practical limits.

   title: Thus Spake Long-Context Large Language Model
   summary: Long context is an important topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP),
running through the development of NLP architectures, and offers immense
opportunities for Large Language Models (LLMs) giving LLMs the lifelong
learning potential akin to humans. Unfortunately, the pursuit of a long context
is accompanied by numerous obstacles. Nevertheless, long context remains a core
competitive advantage for LLMs. In the past two years, the context length of
LLMs has achieved a breakthrough extension to millions of tokens. Moreover, the
research on long-context LLMs has expanded from length extrapolation to a
comprehensive focus on architecture, infrastructure, training, and evaluation
technologies.
  Inspired by the symphonic poem, Thus Spake Zarathustra, we draw an analogy
between the journey of extending the context of LLM and the attempts of humans
to transcend its mortality. In this survey, We will illustrate how LLM
struggles between the tremendous need for a longer context and its equal need
to accept the fact that it is ultimately finite. To achieve this, we give a
global picture of the lifecycle of long-context LLMs from four perspectives:
architecture, infrastructure, training, and evaluation, showcasing the full
spectrum of long-context technologies. At the end of this survey, we will
present 10 unanswered questions currently faced by long-context LLMs. We hope
this survey can serve as a systematic introduction to the research on
long-context LLMs.

(SLMs) on a single academic GPU in 24 hours. We do so through empirical
analysis of model initialisation and architecture, synthetic training data,
preference optimisation with synthetic data and tweaking all other components.
We empirically demonstrate that this training recipe also scales well with more
compute getting results on par with leading SLMs in a fraction of the compute
cost. We hope these insights will make SLM training and research more
accessible. In the context of SLM scaling laws, our results far outperform
predicted compute optimal performance, giving an optimistic view to SLM
feasibility. See code, data, models, samples at -

   title: Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models
   summary: We show that reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs)
significantly boosts performance on complex coding and reasoning tasks.
Additionally, we compare two general-purpose reasoning models - OpenAI o1 and
an early checkpoint of o3 - with a domain-specific system, o1-ioi, which uses
hand-engineered inference strategies designed for competing in the 2024
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). We competed live at IOI 2024 with
o1-ioi and, using hand-crafted test-time strategies, placed in the 49th
percentile. Under relaxed competition constraints, o1-ioi achieved a gold
medal. However, when evaluating later models such as o3, we find that o3
achieves gold without hand-crafted domain-specific strategies or relaxed
constraints. Our findings show that although specialized pipelines such as
o1-ioi yield solid improvements, the scaled-up, general-purpose o3 model
surpasses those results without relying on hand-crafted inference heuristics.
Notably, o3 achieves a gold medal at the 2024 IOI and obtains a Codeforces
rating on par with elite human competitors. Overall, these results indicate
that scaling general-purpose reinforcement learning, rather than relying on
domain-specific techniques, offers a robust path toward state-of-the-art AI in
reasoning domains, such as competitive programming.

   title: GHOST 2.0: generative high-fidelity one shot transfer of heads
   summary: While the task of face swapping has recently gained attention in the research
community, a related problem of head swapping remains largely unexplored. In
addition to skin color transfer, head swap poses extra challenges, such as the
need to preserve structural information of the whole head during synthesis and
inpaint gaps between swapped head and background. In this paper, we address
these concerns with GHOST 2.0, which consists of two problem-specific modules.
First, we introduce enhanced Aligner model for head reenactment, which
preserves identity information at multiple scales and is robust to extreme pose
variations. Secondly, we use a Blender module that seamlessly integrates the
reenacted head into the target background by transferring skin color and
inpainting mismatched regions. Both modules outperform the baselines on the
corresponding tasks, allowing to achieve state of the art results in head
swapping. We also tackle complex cases, such as large difference in hair styles
of source and target. Code is available at

   title: VideoJAM: Joint Appearance-Motion Representations for Enhanced Motion
  Generation in Video Models
   summary: Despite tremendous recent progress, generative video models still struggle to
capture real-world motion, dynamics, and physics. We show that this limitation
arises from the conventional pixel reconstruction objective, which biases
models toward appearance fidelity at the expense of motion coherence. To
address this, we introduce VideoJAM, a novel framework that instills an
effective motion prior to video generators, by encouraging the model to learn a
joint appearance-motion representation. VideoJAM is composed of two
complementary units. During training, we extend the objective to predict both
the generated pixels and their corresponding motion from a single learned
representation. During inference, we introduce Inner-Guidance, a mechanism that
steers the generation toward coherent motion by leveraging the model's own
evolving motion prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. Notably, our framework
can be applied to any video model with minimal adaptations, requiring no
modifications to the training data or scaling of the model. VideoJAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance in motion coherence, surpassing highly competitive
proprietary models while also enhancing the perceived visual quality of the
generations. These findings emphasize that appearance and motion can be
complementary and, when effectively integrated, enhance both the visual quality
and the coherence of video generation. Project website:

   title: Kanana: Compute-efficient Bilingual Language Models
   summary: We introduce Kanana, a series of bilingual language models that demonstrate
exceeding performance in Korean and competitive performance in English. The
computational cost of Kanana is significantly lower than that of
state-of-the-art models of similar size. The report details the techniques
employed during pre-training to achieve compute-efficient yet competitive
models, including high quality data filtering, staged pre-training, depth
up-scaling, and pruning and distillation. Furthermore, the report outlines the
methodologies utilized during the post-training of the Kanana models,
encompassing supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, aimed at
enhancing their capability for seamless interaction with users. Lastly, the
report elaborates on plausible approaches used for language model adaptation to
specific scenarios, such as embedding, retrieval augmented generation, and
function calling. The Kanana model series spans from 2.1B to 32.5B parameters

   title: VideoRoPE: What Makes for Good Video Rotary Position Embedding?
   summary: While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and its variants are widely adopted
for their long-context capabilities, the extension of the 1D RoPE to video,
with its complex spatio-temporal structure, remains an open challenge. This
work first introduces a comprehensive analysis that identifies four key
characteristics essential for the effective adaptation of RoPE to video, which
have not been fully considered in prior work. As part of our analysis, we
introduce a challenging V-NIAH-D (Visual Needle-In-A-Haystack with Distractors)
task, which adds periodic distractors into V-NIAH. The V-NIAH-D task
demonstrates that previous RoPE variants, lacking appropriate temporal
dimension allocation, are easily misled by distractors. Based on our analysis,
we introduce VideoRoPE, with a 3D structure designed to
preserve spatio-temporal relationships. VideoRoPE features
low-frequency temporal allocation to mitigate periodic oscillations, a
diagonal layout to maintain spatial symmetry, and adjustable
temporal spacing to decouple temporal and spatial indexing. VideoRoPE
consistently surpasses previous RoPE variants, across diverse downstream tasks
such as long video retrieval, video understanding, and video hallucination. Our
code will be available at

   title: MedVLM-R1: Incentivizing Medical Reasoning Capability of Vision-Language
  Models (VLMs) via Reinforcement Learning
   summary: Reasoning is a critical frontier for advancing medical image analysis, where
transparency and trustworthiness play a central role in both clinician trust
and regulatory approval. Although Medical Visual Language Models (VLMs) show
promise for radiological tasks, most existing VLMs merely produce final answers
without revealing the underlying reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce
MedVLM-R1, a medical VLM that explicitly generates natural language reasoning
to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Instead of relying on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), which often suffers from overfitting to training
distributions and fails to foster genuine reasoning, MedVLM-R1 employs a
reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the model to discover
human-interpretable reasoning paths without using any reasoning references.
Despite limited training data (600 visual question answering samples) and model
parameters (2B), MedVLM-R1 boosts accuracy from 55.11% to 78.22% across MRI,
CT, and X-ray benchmarks, outperforming larger models trained on over a million
samples. It also demonstrates robust domain generalization under
out-of-distribution tasks. By unifying medical image analysis with explicit
reasoning, MedVLM-R1 marks a pivotal step toward trustworthy and interpretable
AI in clinical practice.

   title: S*: Test Time Scaling for Code Generation
   summary: Increasing test-time compute for LLMs shows promise across domains but
remains underexplored in code generation, despite extensive study in math. In
this paper, we propose S*, the first hybrid test-time scaling framework that
substantially improves the coverage and selection accuracy of generated code.
S* extends the existing parallel scaling paradigm with sequential scaling to
push performance boundaries. It further leverages a novel selection mechanism
that adaptively generates distinguishing inputs for pairwise comparison,
combined with execution-grounded information to robustly identify correct
solutions. We evaluate across 12 Large Language Models and Large Reasoning
Model and show: (1) S* consistently improves performance across model families
and sizes, enabling a 3B model to outperform GPT-4o-mini; (2) S* enables
non-reasoning models to surpass reasoning models - GPT-4o-mini with S*
outperforms o1-preview by 3.7% on LiveCodeBench; (3) S* further boosts
state-of-the-art reasoning models - DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B with S*
achieves 85.7% on LiveCodeBench, approaching o1 (high) at 88.5%. Code will be

   title: LIMO: Less is More for Reasoning
   summary: We present a fundamental discovery that challenges our understanding of how
complex reasoning emerges in large language models. While conventional wisdom
suggests that sophisticated reasoning tasks demand extensive training data
(>100,000 examples), we demonstrate that complex mathematical reasoning
abilities can be effectively elicited with surprisingly few examples. Through
comprehensive experiments, our proposed model LIMO demonstrates unprecedented
performance in mathematical reasoning. With merely 817 curated training
samples, LIMO achieves 57.1% accuracy on AIME and 94.8% on MATH, improving from
previous SFT-based models' 6.5% and 59.2% respectively, while only using 1% of
the training data required by previous approaches. LIMO demonstrates
exceptional out-of-distribution generalization, achieving 40.5% absolute
improvement across 10 diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x
more data, challenging the notion that SFT leads to memorization rather than
generalization. Based on these results, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning
Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has
been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning
capabilities can emerge through minimal but precisely orchestrated
demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis posits that the
elicitation threshold for complex reasoning is determined by two key factors:
(1) the completeness of the model's encoded knowledge foundation during
pre-training, and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples as "cognitive
templates" that show the model how to utilize its knowledge base to solve
complex reasoning tasks. To facilitate reproducibility and future research in
data-efficient reasoning, we release LIMO as a comprehensive open-source suite

   title: Process Reinforcement through Implicit Rewards
   summary: Dense process rewards have proven a more effective alternative to the sparse
outcome-level rewards in the inference-time scaling of large language models
(LLMs), particularly in tasks requiring complex multi-step reasoning. While
dense rewards also offer an appealing choice for the reinforcement learning
(RL) of LLMs since their fine-grained rewards have the potential to address
some inherent issues of outcome rewards, such as training efficiency and credit
assignment, this potential remains largely unrealized. This can be primarily
attributed to the challenges of training process reward models (PRMs) online,
where collecting high-quality process labels is prohibitively expensive, making
them particularly vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these challenges, we
propose PRIME (Process Reinforcement through IMplicit rEwards), which enables
online PRM updates using only policy rollouts and outcome labels through
implict process rewards. PRIME combines well with various advantage functions
and forgoes the dedicated reward model training phrase that existing approaches
require, substantially reducing the development overhead. We demonstrate
PRIME's effectiveness on competitional math and coding. Starting from
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, PRIME achieves a 15.1% average improvement across several
key reasoning benchmarks over the SFT model. Notably, our resulting model,
Eurus-2-7B-PRIME, surpasses Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on seven reasoning
benchmarks with 10% of its training data.
   id: 2502.01456
   ai_summary: PRIME leverages implicit process rewards to improve the reinforcement learning of large language models, achieving better performance with less data compared to traditional methods.

   title: Analyze Feature Flow to Enhance Interpretation and Steering in Language
  Models
   summary: We introduce a new approach to systematically map features discovered by
sparse autoencoder across consecutive layers of large language models,
extending earlier work that examined inter-layer feature links. By using a
data-free cosine similarity technique, we trace how specific features persist,
transform, or first appear at each stage. This method yields granular flow
graphs of feature evolution, enabling fine-grained interpretability and
mechanistic insights into model computations. Crucially, we demonstrate how
these cross-layer feature maps facilitate direct steering of model behavior by
amplifying or suppressing chosen features, achieving targeted thematic control
in text generation. Together, our findings highlight the utility of a causal,
cross-layer interpretability framework that not only clarifies how features
develop through forward passes but also provides new means for transparent
manipulation of large language models.

   title: SpargeAttn: Accurate Sparse Attention Accelerating Any Model Inference
   summary: An efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to
its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits
sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for
the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the
sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on
optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse
patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees
both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive.
In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized
attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the
first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the
skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we
design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further
skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method
significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video
generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics. The codes are available at
https://github.com/thu-ml/SpargeAttn.

   ai_summary: SpargeAttn is a universal sparse and quantized attention method that accelerates diverse models by predicting the attention map and using an online softmax-aware filter to skip unnecessary matrix multiplications.

   title: Phantom: Subject-consistent video generation via cross-modal alignment
   summary: The continuous development of foundational models for video generation is
evolving into various applications, with subject-consistent video generation
still in the exploratory stage. We refer to this as Subject-to-Video, which
extracts subject elements from reference images and generates
subject-consistent video through textual instructions. We believe that the
essence of subject-to-video lies in balancing the dual-modal prompts of text
and image, thereby deeply and simultaneously aligning both text and visual
content. To this end, we propose Phantom, a unified video generation framework
for both single and multi-subject references. Building on existing
text-to-video and image-to-video architectures, we redesign the joint
text-image injection model and drive it to learn cross-modal alignment via
text-image-video triplet data. In particular, we emphasize subject consistency
in human generation, covering existing ID-preserving video generation while
offering enhanced advantages. The project homepage is here

   title: Magma: A Foundation Model for Multimodal AI Agents
   summary: We present Magma, a foundation model that serves multimodal AI agentic tasks
in both the digital and physical worlds. Magma is a significant extension of
vision-language (VL) models in that it not only retains the VL understanding
ability (verbal intelligence) of the latter, but is also equipped with the
ability to plan and act in the visual-spatial world (spatial-temporal
intelligence) and complete agentic tasks ranging from UI navigation to robot
manipulation. To endow the agentic capabilities, Magma is pretrained on large
amounts of heterogeneous datasets spanning from images, videos to robotics
data, where the actionable visual objects (e.g., clickable buttons in GUI) in
images are labeled by Set-of-Mark (SoM) for action grounding, and the object
movements (e.g., the trace of human hands or robotic arms) in videos are
labeled by Trace-of-Mark (ToM) for action planning. Extensive experiments show
that SoM and ToM reach great synergy and facilitate the acquisition of
spatial-temporal intelligence for our Magma model, which is fundamental to a
wide range of tasks as shown in Fig.1. In particular, Magma creates new
state-of-the-art results on UI navigation and robotic manipulation tasks,
outperforming previous models that are specifically tailored to these tasks. On
image and video-related multimodal tasks, Magma also compares favorably to
popular large multimodal models that are trained on much larger datasets. We
make our model and code public for reproducibility at
https://microsoft.github.io/Magma.
   id: 2502.13130
   ai_summary: Magma is a multimodal foundation model with both verbal intelligence and spatial-temporal intelligence, trained on diverse datasets to perform agentic tasks like UI navigation and robotic manipulation, outperforming specialized models.

   title: Fino1: On the Transferability of Reasoning Enhanced LLMs to Finance
   summary: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong general
reasoning abilities, yet their effectiveness in financial reasoning remains
underexplored. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate 16 powerful reasoning
and general LLMs on three complex financial tasks involving financial text,
tabular data, and equations, assessing numerical reasoning, tabular
interpretation, financial terminology comprehension, long-context processing,
and equation-based problem solving. Our results show that while better datasets
and pretraining improve financial reasoning, general enhancements like CoT
fine-tuning do not always yield consistent gains. Moreover, all reasoning
strategies face challenges in improving performance on long-context and
multi-table tasks. To address these limitations, we develop a financial
reasoning-enhanced model based on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, by CoT fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning with domain-specific reasoning paths. Even with simple
fine-tuning with one financial dataset, our model achieves a consistent 10%
performance improvement across tasks, surpassing all 8B models and even
Llama3-70B-Instruct and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct on average. Our results highlight
the need for domain-specific adaptations in financial tasks, emphasizing future
directions such as multi-table reasoning, long-context processing, and
financial terminology comprehension. All our datasets, models, and codes are
publicly available. Furthermore, we introduce a leaderboard for benchmarking
future datasets and models.

   title: Exploring the Limit of Outcome Reward for Learning Mathematical
  Reasoning
   summary: Reasoning abilities, especially those for solving complex math problems, are
crucial components of general intelligence. Recent advances by proprietary
companies, such as o-series models of OpenAI, have made remarkable progress on
reasoning tasks. However, the complete technical details remain unrevealed, and
the techniques that are believed certainly to be adopted are only reinforcement
learning (RL) and the long chain of thoughts. This paper proposes a new RL
framework, termed OREAL, to pursue the performance limit that can be achieved
through Outcome REwArd-based reinforcement
Learning for mathematical reasoning tasks, where only binary outcome
rewards are easily accessible. We theoretically prove that behavior cloning on
positive trajectories from best-of-N (BoN) sampling is sufficient to learn the
KL-regularized optimal policy in binary feedback environments. This formulation
further implies that the rewards of negative samples should be reshaped to
ensure the gradient consistency between positive and negative samples. To
alleviate the long-existing difficulties brought by sparse rewards in RL, which
are even exacerbated by the partial correctness of the long chain of thought
for reasoning tasks, we further apply a token-level reward model to sample
important tokens in reasoning trajectories for learning. With OREAL, for the
first time, a 7B model can obtain 94.0 pass@1 accuracy on MATH-500 through RL,
being on par with 32B models. OREAL-32B also surpasses previous 32B models
trained by distillation with 95.0 pass@1 accuracy on MATH-500. Our
investigation also indicates the importance of initial policy models and
training queries for RL. Code, models, and data will be released to benefit
future researchhttps://github.com/InternLM/OREAL.

   ai_summary: A novel reinforcement learning framework, OREAL, using outcome rewards achieves high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks with smaller models compared to larger models trained using distillation.

   title: Demystifying Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs
   summary: Scaling inference compute enhances reasoning in large language models (LLMs),
with long chains-of-thought (CoTs) enabling strategies like backtracking and
error correction. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial method
for developing these capabilities, yet the conditions under which long CoTs
emerge remain unclear, and RL training requires careful design choices. In this
study, we systematically investigate the mechanics of long CoT reasoning,
identifying the key factors that enable models to generate long CoT
trajectories. Through extensive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL
experiments, we present four main findings: (1) While SFT is not strictly
necessary, it simplifies training and improves efficiency; (2) Reasoning
capabilities tend to emerge with increased training compute, but their
development is not guaranteed, making reward shaping crucial for stabilizing
CoT length growth; (3) Scaling verifiable reward signals is critical for RL. We
find that leveraging noisy, web-extracted solutions with filtering mechanisms
shows strong potential, particularly for out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks such
as STEM reasoning; and (4) Core abilities like error correction are inherently
present in base models, but incentivizing these skills effectively for complex
tasks via RL demands significant compute, and measuring their emergence
requires a nuanced approach. These insights provide practical guidance for
optimizing training strategies to enhance long CoT reasoning in LLMs. Our code
is available at: https://github.com/eddycmu/demystify-long-cot.

   title: TransMLA: Multi-head Latent Attention Is All You Need
   summary: Modern large language models (LLMs) often encounter communication bottlenecks
on current hardware, rather than purely computational constraints. Multi-head
Latent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the
key-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be
cached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to
traditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA
employs an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional
computation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated
efficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers
still rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to
adopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA
while maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold.
To encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce **TransMLA**, a post-training
method that converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA,
Qwen, Mixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo
additional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache
size. Furthermore, we plan to develop MLA-specific inference acceleration
techniques to preserve low latency in transformed models, thus enabling more
efficient distillation of Deepseek R1.

   title: Step-Video-T2V Technical Report: The Practice, Challenges, and Future of
  Video Foundation Model
   summary: We present Step-Video-T2V, a state-of-the-art text-to-video pre-trained model
with 30B parameters and the ability to generate videos up to 204 frames in
length. A deep compression Variational Autoencoder, Video-VAE, is designed for
video generation tasks, achieving 16x16 spatial and 8x temporal compression
ratios, while maintaining exceptional video reconstruction quality. User
prompts are encoded using two bilingual text encoders to handle both English
and Chinese. A DiT with 3D full attention is trained using Flow Matching and is
employed to denoise input noise into latent frames. A video-based DPO approach,
Video-DPO, is applied to reduce artifacts and improve the visual quality of the
generated videos. We also detail our training strategies and share key
observations and insights. Step-Video-T2V's performance is evaluated on a novel
video generation benchmark, Step-Video-T2V-Eval, demonstrating its
state-of-the-art text-to-video quality when compared with both open-source and
commercial engines. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of current
diffusion-based model paradigm and outline future directions for video
foundation models. We make both Step-Video-T2V and Step-Video-T2V-Eval
available at https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step-Video-T2V. The online version

   title: Continuous Diffusion Model for Language Modeling
   summary: Diffusion models have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive
models in modeling discrete categorical data. Yet diffusion models that
directly work on discrete data space do not fully exploit the power of
iterative refinement, as the signals are lost during the transition between
discrete states. Existing continuous diffusion models for discrete data have
limited performance compared to discrete approaches, and the unclear link
between them restricts the development of diffusion models for discrete data.
In this work, we propose a continuous diffusion model for language modeling
that incorporates the geometry of the underlying categorical distribution. We
establish a connection between the discrete diffusion and continuous flow on
the statistical manifold, and building on the analogy, we introduce a simple
design for the diffusion process that generalizes previous discrete diffusion
models. We further propose a simulation-free training framework based on radial
symmetry and a simple technique to address the high dimensionality of the
manifold. Comprehensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks and other
modalities show that our method outperforms existing discrete diffusion models
and approaches the performance of autoregressive models. Codes available at

   title: Region-Adaptive Sampling for Diffusion Transformers
   summary: Diffusion models (DMs) have become the leading choice for generative tasks
across diverse domains. However, their reliance on multiple sequential forward
passes significantly limits real-time performance. Previous acceleration
methods have primarily focused on reducing the number of sampling steps or
reusing intermediate results, failing to leverage variations across spatial
regions within the image due to the constraints of convolutional U-Net
structures. By harnessing the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in
handling variable number of tokens, we introduce RAS, a novel, training-free
sampling strategy that dynamically assigns different sampling ratios to regions
within an image based on the focus of the DiT model. Our key observation is
that during each sampling step, the model concentrates on semantically
meaningful regions, and these areas of focus exhibit strong continuity across
consecutive steps. Leveraging this insight, RAS updates only the regions
currently in focus, while other regions are updated using cached noise from the
previous step. The model's focus is determined based on the output from the
preceding step, capitalizing on the temporal consistency we observed. We
evaluate RAS on Stable Diffusion 3 and Lumina-Next-T2I, achieving speedups up
to 2.36x and 2.51x, respectively, with minimal degradation in generation
quality. Additionally, a user study reveals that RAS delivers comparable
qualities under human evaluation while achieving a 1.6x speedup. Our approach
makes a significant step towards more efficient diffusion transformers,
enhancing their potential for real-time applications.

   title: BenchMAX: A Comprehensive Multilingual Evaluation Suite for Large
  Language Models
   summary: Previous multilingual benchmarks focus primarily on simple understanding
tasks, but for large language models(LLMs), we emphasize proficiency in
instruction following, reasoning, long context understanding, code generation,
and so on. However, measuring these advanced capabilities across languages is
underexplored. To address the disparity, we introduce BenchMAX, a multi-way
multilingual evaluation benchmark that allows for fair comparisons of these
important abilities across languages. To maintain high quality, three distinct
native-speaking annotators independently annotate each sample within all tasks
after the data was machine-translated from English into 16 other languages.
Additionally, we present a novel translation challenge stemming from dataset
construction. Extensive experiments on BenchMAX reveal varying effectiveness of
core capabilities across languages, highlighting performance gaps that cannot
be bridged by simply scaling up model size. BenchMAX serves as a comprehensive
multilingual evaluation platform, providing a promising test bed to promote the
development of multilingual language models. The dataset and code are publicly
accessible.

   title: Towards an AI co-scientist
   summary: Scientific discovery relies on scientists generating novel hypotheses that
undergo rigorous experimental validation. To augment this process, we introduce
an AI co-scientist, a multi-agent system built on Gemini 2.0. The AI
co-scientist is intended to help uncover new, original knowledge and to
formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon
prior evidence and aligned to scientist-provided research objectives and
guidance. The system's design incorporates a generate, debate, and evolve
approach to hypothesis generation, inspired by the scientific method and
accelerated by scaling test-time compute. Key contributions include: (1) a
multi-agent architecture with an asynchronous task execution framework for
flexible compute scaling; (2) a tournament evolution process for self-improving
hypotheses generation. Automated evaluations show continued benefits of
test-time compute, improving hypothesis quality. While general purpose, we
focus development and validation in three biomedical areas: drug repurposing,
novel target discovery, and explaining mechanisms of bacterial evolution and
anti-microbial resistance. For drug repurposing, the system proposes candidates
with promising validation findings, including candidates for acute myeloid
leukemia that show tumor inhibition in vitro at clinically applicable
concentrations. For novel target discovery, the AI co-scientist proposed new
epigenetic targets for liver fibrosis, validated by anti-fibrotic activity and
liver cell regeneration in human hepatic organoids. Finally, the AI
co-scientist recapitulated unpublished experimental results via a parallel in
silico discovery of a novel gene transfer mechanism in bacterial evolution.
These results, detailed in separate, co-timed reports, demonstrate the
potential to augment biomedical and scientific discovery and usher an era of AI
empowered scientists.

   title: Feature-Level Insights into Artificial Text Detection with Sparse
  Autoencoders
   summary: Artificial Text Detection (ATD) is becoming increasingly important with the
rise of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite numerous efforts, no
single algorithm performs consistently well across different types of unseen
text or guarantees effective generalization to new LLMs. Interpretability plays
a crucial role in achieving this goal. In this study, we enhance ATD
interpretability by using Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) to extract features from
Gemma-2-2b residual stream. We identify both interpretable and efficient
features, analyzing their semantics and relevance through domain- and
model-specific statistics, a steering approach, and manual or LLM-based
interpretation. Our methods offer valuable insights into how texts from various
models differ from human-written content. We show that modern LLMs have a
distinct writing style, especially in information-dense domains, even though
they can produce human-like outputs with personalized prompts.

   title: Transformers without Normalization
   summary: Normalization layers are ubiquitous in modern neural networks and have long
been considered essential. This work demonstrates that Transformers without
normalization can achieve the same or better performance using a remarkably
simple technique. We introduce Dynamic Tanh (DyT), an element-wise operation
DyT(x) = tanh(alpha x), as a drop-in replacement for normalization
layers in Transformers. DyT is inspired by the observation that layer
normalization in Transformers often produces tanh-like, S-shaped input-output
mappings. By incorporating DyT, Transformers without normalization can match or
exceed the performance of their normalized counterparts, mostly without
hyperparameter tuning. We validate the effectiveness of Transformers with DyT
across diverse settings, ranging from recognition to generation, supervised to
self-supervised learning, and computer vision to language models. These
findings challenge the conventional understanding that normalization layers are
indispensable in modern neural networks, and offer new insights into their role
in deep networks.

   title: Qwen2.5-Omni Technical Report
   summary: In this report, we present Qwen2.5-Omni, an end-to-end multimodal model
designed to perceive diverse modalities, including text, images, audio, and
video, while simultaneously generating text and natural speech responses in a
streaming manner. To enable the streaming of multimodal information inputs,
both audio and visual encoders utilize a block-wise processing approach. To
synchronize the timestamps of video inputs with audio, we organize the audio
and video sequentially in an interleaved manner and propose a novel position
embedding approach, named TMRoPE(Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE). To concurrently
generate text and speech while avoiding interference between the two
modalities, we propose Thinker-Talker architecture. In this framework,
Thinker functions as a large language model tasked with text generation, while
Talker is a dual-track autoregressive model that directly utilizes the hidden
representations from the Thinker to produce audio tokens as output. Both the
Thinker and Talker models are designed to be trained and inferred in an
end-to-end manner. For decoding audio tokens in a streaming manner, we
introduce a sliding-window DiT that restricts the receptive field, aiming to
reduce the initial package delay. Qwen2.5-Omni is comparable with the similarly
sized Qwen2.5-VL and outperforms Qwen2-Audio. Furthermore, Qwen2.5-Omni
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal benchmarks like Omni-Bench.
Notably, Qwen2.5-Omni's performance in end-to-end speech instruction following
is comparable to its capabilities with text inputs, as evidenced by benchmarks
such as MMLU and GSM8K. As for speech generation, Qwen2.5-Omni's streaming
Talker outperforms most existing streaming and non-streaming alternatives in
robustness and naturalness.
   id: 2503.20215
   ai_summary: Qwen2.5-Omni is a multimodal model that processes text, images, audio, and video in a streaming fashion and generates text and speech using a dual-track architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multimodal benchmarks.

   title: RWKV-7 "Goose" with Expressive Dynamic State Evolution
   summary: We present RWKV-7 "Goose", a new sequence modeling architecture, along with
pre-trained language models that establish a new state-of-the-art in downstream
performance at the 3 billion parameter scale on multilingual tasks, and match
current SoTA English language performance despite being trained on dramatically
fewer tokens than other top 3B models. Nevertheless, RWKV-7 models require only
constant memory usage and constant inference time per token. RWKV-7 introduces
a newly generalized formulation of the delta rule with vector-valued gating and
in-context learning rates, as well as a relaxed value replacement rule. We show
that RWKV-7 can perform state tracking and recognize all regular languages,
while retaining parallelizability of training. This exceeds the capabilities of
Transformers under standard complexity conjectures, which are limited to
TC^0. To demonstrate RWKV-7's language modeling capability, we also
present an extended open source 3.1 trillion token multilingual corpus, and
train four RWKV-7 models ranging from 0.19 billion to 2.9 billion parameters on
this dataset.
  To foster openness, reproduction, and adoption, we release our models and
dataset component listing at https://huggingface.co/RWKV, and our training and
inference code at https://github.com/RWKV/RWKV-LM all under the Apache 2.0

   title: ReCamMaster: Camera-Controlled Generative Rendering from A Single Video
   summary: Camera control has been actively studied in text or image conditioned video
generation tasks. However, altering camera trajectories of a given video
remains under-explored, despite its importance in the field of video creation.
It is non-trivial due to the extra constraints of maintaining multiple-frame
appearance and dynamic synchronization. To address this, we present
ReCamMaster, a camera-controlled generative video re-rendering framework that
reproduces the dynamic scene of an input video at novel camera trajectories.
The core innovation lies in harnessing the generative capabilities of
pre-trained text-to-video models through a simple yet powerful video
conditioning mechanism -- its capability often overlooked in current research.
To overcome the scarcity of qualified training data, we construct a
comprehensive multi-camera synchronized video dataset using Unreal Engine 5,
which is carefully curated to follow real-world filming characteristics,
covering diverse scenes and camera movements. It helps the model generalize to
in-the-wild videos. Lastly, we further improve the robustness to diverse inputs
through a meticulously designed training strategy. Extensive experiments tell
that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches
and strong baselines. Our method also finds promising applications in video
stabilization, super-resolution, and outpainting. Project page:

   title: DAPO: An Open-Source LLM Reinforcement Learning System at Scale
   summary: Inference scaling empowers LLMs with unprecedented reasoning ability, with
reinforcement learning as the core technique to elicit complex reasoning.
However, key technical details of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are concealed
(such as in OpenAI o1 blog and DeepSeek R1 technical report), thus the
community still struggles to reproduce their RL training results. We propose
the Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling
Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, and
fully open-source a state-of-the-art large-scale RL system that achieves 50
points on AIME 2024 using Qwen2.5-32B base model. Unlike previous works that
withhold training details, we introduce four key techniques of our algorithm
that make large-scale LLM RL a success. In addition, we open-source our
training code, which is built on the verl framework, along with a carefully
curated and processed dataset. These components of our open-source system
enhance reproducibility and support future research in large-scale LLM RL.

   title: MoCha: Towards Movie-Grade Talking Character Synthesis
   summary: Recent advancements in video generation have achieved impressive motion
realism, yet they often overlook character-driven storytelling, a crucial task
for automated film, animation generation. We introduce Talking Characters, a
more realistic task to generate talking character animations directly from
speech and text. Unlike talking head, Talking Characters aims at generating the
full portrait of one or more characters beyond the facial region. In this
paper, we propose MoCha, the first of its kind to generate talking characters.
To ensure precise synchronization between video and speech, we propose a
speech-video window attention mechanism that effectively aligns speech and
video tokens. To address the scarcity of large-scale speech-labeled video
datasets, we introduce a joint training strategy that leverages both
speech-labeled and text-labeled video data, significantly improving
generalization across diverse character actions. We also design structured
prompt templates with character tags, enabling, for the first time,
multi-character conversation with turn-based dialogue-allowing AI-generated
characters to engage in context-aware conversations with cinematic coherence.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including human preference
studies and benchmark comparisons, demonstrate that MoCha sets a new standard
for AI-generated cinematic storytelling, achieving superior realism,
expressiveness, controllability and generalization.

A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence
while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying
viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily
focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination,
such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without
constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may
introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby
overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with
numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes
increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral
spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression
and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent
generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the
development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset,
which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object
actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words,
detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we
developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving
spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The DropletVideo dataset and
model are accessible at https://dropletx.github.io.

   title: RuCCoD: Towards Automated ICD Coding in Russian
   summary: This study investigates the feasibility of automating clinical coding in
Russian, a language with limited biomedical resources. We present a new dataset
for ICD coding, which includes diagnosis fields from electronic health records
(EHRs) annotated with over 10,000 entities and more than 1,500 unique ICD
codes. This dataset serves as a benchmark for several state-of-the-art models,
including BERT, LLaMA with LoRA, and RAG, with additional experiments examining
transfer learning across domains (from PubMed abstracts to medical diagnosis)
and terminologies (from UMLS concepts to ICD codes). We then apply the
best-performing model to label an in-house EHR dataset containing patient
histories from 2017 to 2021. Our experiments, conducted on a carefully curated
test set, demonstrate that training with the automated predicted codes leads to
a significant improvement in accuracy compared to manually annotated data from
physicians. We believe our findings offer valuable insights into the potential
for automating clinical coding in resource-limited languages like Russian,
which could enhance clinical efficiency and data accuracy in these contexts.

   title: SmolDocling: An ultra-compact vision-language model for end-to-end
  multi-modal document conversion
   summary: We introduce SmolDocling, an ultra-compact vision-language model targeting
end-to-end document conversion. Our model comprehensively processes entire
pages by generating DocTags, a new universal markup format that captures all
page elements in their full context with location. Unlike existing approaches
that rely on large foundational models, or ensemble solutions that rely on
handcrafted pipelines of multiple specialized models, SmolDocling offers an
end-to-end conversion for accurately capturing content, structure and spatial
location of document elements in a 256M parameters vision-language model.
SmolDocling exhibits robust performance in correctly reproducing document
features such as code listings, tables, equations, charts, lists, and more
across a diverse range of document types including business documents, academic
papers, technical reports, patents, and forms -- significantly extending beyond
the commonly observed focus on scientific papers. Additionally, we contribute
novel publicly sourced datasets for charts, tables, equations, and code
recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that SmolDocling competes with
other Vision Language Models that are up to 27 times larger in size, while
reducing computational requirements substantially. The model is currently
available, datasets will be publicly available soon.
   id: 2503.11576
   ai_summary: SmolDocling is a compact vision-language model that performs end-to-end document conversion with robust performance across various document types using 256M parameters and a new markup format.

   title: Unified Reward Model for Multimodal Understanding and Generation
   summary: Recent advances in human preference alignment have significantly enhanced
multimodal generation and understanding. A key approach is training reward
models to guide preference optimization. However, existing models are often
task-specific, limiting their adaptability across diverse visual applications.
We also argue that jointly learning to assess multiple tasks may foster a
synergistic effect, where improved image understanding enhances image
generation assessment, and refined image evaluation benefits video assessment
through better frame analysis. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward,
the first unified reward model for multimodal understanding and generation
assessment, enabling both pairwise ranking and pointwise scoring, which can be
employed for vision model preference alignment. Specifically, (1) we first
develop UnifiedReward on our constructed large-scale human preference dataset,
including both image and video generation/understanding tasks. (2) Then, it is
utilized to automatically construct high-quality preference pair data based on
the vision models, fine-gradually filtering their outputs through pair ranking
and point sifting. (3) Finally, these data are used for their preference
alignment through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results
demonstrate that joint learning to assess diverse visual tasks can lead to
substantial mutual benefits and we apply our pipeline to both image and video
understanding/generation tasks, significantly improving the performance in each
domain.

   title: I Have Covered All the Bases Here: Interpreting Reasoning Features in
  Large Language Models via Sparse Autoencoders
   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing. Recent advances have led to the developing of a new class
of reasoning LLMs; for example, open-source DeepSeek-R1 has achieved
state-of-the-art performance by integrating deep thinking and complex
reasoning. Despite these impressive capabilities, the internal reasoning
mechanisms of such models remain unexplored. In this work, we employ Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), a method to learn a sparse decomposition of latent
representations of a neural network into interpretable features, to identify
features that drive reasoning in the DeepSeek-R1 series of models. First, we
propose an approach to extract candidate ''reasoning features'' from SAE
representations. We validate these features through empirical analysis and
interpretability methods, demonstrating their direct correlation with the
model's reasoning abilities. Crucially, we demonstrate that steering these
features systematically enhances reasoning performance, offering the first
mechanistic account of reasoning in LLMs. Code available at
https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/SAE-Reasoning

   title: START: Self-taught Reasoner with Tools
   summary: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks through the
utilization of long Chain-of-thought (CoT). However, these models often suffer
from hallucinations and inefficiencies due to their reliance solely on internal
reasoning processes. In this paper, we introduce START (Self-Taught Reasoner
with Tools), a novel tool-integrated long CoT reasoning LLM that significantly
enhances reasoning capabilities by leveraging external tools. Through code
execution, START is capable of performing complex computations, self-checking,
exploring diverse methods, and self-debugging, thereby addressing the
limitations of LRMs. The core innovation of START lies in its self-learning
framework, which comprises two key techniques: 1) Hint-infer: We demonstrate
that inserting artificially designed hints (e.g., ``Wait, maybe using Python
here is a good idea.'') during the inference process of a LRM effectively
stimulates its ability to utilize external tools without the need for any
demonstration data. Hint-infer can also serve as a simple and effective
sequential test-time scaling method; 2) Hint Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning
(Hint-RFT): Hint-RFT combines Hint-infer and RFT by scoring, filtering, and
modifying the reasoning trajectories with tool invocation generated by a LRM
via Hint-infer, followed by fine-tuning the LRM. Through this framework, we
have fine-tuned the QwQ-32B model to achieve START. On PhD-level science QA
(GPQA), competition-level math benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24, AIME25), and the
competition-level code benchmark (LiveCodeBench), START achieves accuracy rates
of 63.6%, 95.0%, 66.7%, 47.1%, and 47.3%, respectively. It significantly
outperforms the base QwQ-32B and achieves performance comparable to the
state-of-the-art open-weight model R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and the proprietary
model o1-Preview.

   ai_summary: START integrates external tools into large reasoning models to enhance capabilities, using techniques like Hint-infer and Hint Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning, achieving high performance across various benchmarks.

   title: Crowdsource, Crawl, or Generate? Creating SEA-VL, a Multicultural
  Vision-Language Dataset for Southeast Asia
   summary: Southeast Asia (SEA) is a region of extraordinary linguistic and cultural
diversity, yet it remains significantly underrepresented in vision-language
(VL) research. This often results in artificial intelligence (AI) models that
fail to capture SEA cultural nuances. To fill this gap, we present SEA-VL, an
open-source initiative dedicated to developing high-quality, culturally
relevant data for SEA languages. By involving contributors from SEA countries,
SEA-VL aims to ensure better cultural relevance and diversity, fostering
greater inclusivity of underrepresented languages in VL research. Beyond
crowdsourcing, our initiative goes one step further in the exploration of the
automatic collection of culturally relevant images through crawling and image
generation. First, we find that image crawling achieves approximately ~85%
cultural relevance while being more cost- and time-efficient than
crowdsourcing. Second, despite the substantial progress in generative vision
models, synthetic images remain unreliable in accurately reflecting SEA
cultures. The generated images often fail to reflect the nuanced traditions and
cultural contexts of the region. Collectively, we gather 1.28M SEA
culturally-relevant images, more than 50 times larger than other existing
datasets. Through SEA-VL, we aim to bridge the representation gap in SEA,
fostering the development of more inclusive AI systems that authentically
represent diverse cultures across SEA.
   id: 2503.07920
   ai_summary: SEA-VL is an open-source project aimed at creating a large, culturally relevant dataset for Southeast Asian languages to improve AI inclusivity.

   title: Token-Efficient Long Video Understanding for Multimodal LLMs
   summary: Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs)
have significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as
sequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames
independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which
limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long
videos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM
(Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for
Multimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated
temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder
leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into
image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame
dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only
enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token
reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal
and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM
without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques,
our approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while
improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over
extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves
state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks
(more than 5\% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the
computation costs by up to 8times and the decoding latency by
2.4-2.9times for the fixed numbers of input frames. Project page is
available at https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/storm

   title: Survey on Evaluation of LLM-based Agents
   summary: The emergence of LLM-based agents represents a paradigm shift in AI, enabling
autonomous systems to plan, reason, use tools, and maintain memory while
interacting with dynamic environments. This paper provides the first
comprehensive survey of evaluation methodologies for these increasingly capable
agents. We systematically analyze evaluation benchmarks and frameworks across
four critical dimensions: (1) fundamental agent capabilities, including
planning, tool use, self-reflection, and memory; (2) application-specific
benchmarks for web, software engineering, scientific, and conversational
agents; (3) benchmarks for generalist agents; and (4) frameworks for evaluating
agents. Our analysis reveals emerging trends, including a shift toward more
realistic, challenging evaluations with continuously updated benchmarks. We
also identify critical gaps that future research must address-particularly in
assessing cost-efficiency, safety, and robustness, and in developing
fine-grained, and scalable evaluation methods. This survey maps the rapidly
evolving landscape of agent evaluation, reveals the emerging trends in the
field, identifies current limitations, and proposes directions for future
research.

   title: One-Step Residual Shifting Diffusion for Image Super-Resolution via
  Distillation
   summary: Diffusion models for super-resolution (SR) produce high-quality visual
results but require expensive computational costs. Despite the development of
several methods to accelerate diffusion-based SR models, some (e.g., SinSR)
fail to produce realistic perceptual details, while others (e.g., OSEDiff) may
hallucinate non-existent structures. To overcome these issues, we present RSD,
a new distillation method for ResShift, one of the top diffusion-based SR
models. Our method is based on training the student network to produce such
images that a new fake ResShift model trained on them will coincide with the
teacher model. RSD achieves single-step restoration and outperforms the teacher
by a large margin. We show that our distillation method can surpass the other
distillation-based method for ResShift - SinSR - making it on par with
state-of-the-art diffusion-based SR distillation methods. Compared to SR
methods based on pre-trained text-to-image models, RSD produces competitive
perceptual quality, provides images with better alignment to degraded input
images, and requires fewer parameters and GPU memory. We provide experimental
results on various real-world and synthetic datasets, including RealSR,
RealSet65, DRealSR, ImageNet, and DIV2K.

   title: Charting and Navigating Hugging Face's Model Atlas
   summary: As there are now millions of publicly available neural networks, searching
and analyzing large model repositories becomes increasingly important.
Navigating so many models requires an atlas, but as most models are poorly
documented charting such an atlas is challenging. To explore the hidden
potential of model repositories, we chart a preliminary atlas representing the
documented fraction of Hugging Face. It provides stunning visualizations of the
model landscape and evolution. We demonstrate several applications of this
atlas including predicting model attributes (e.g., accuracy), and analyzing
trends in computer vision models. However, as the current atlas remains
incomplete, we propose a method for charting undocumented regions.
Specifically, we identify high-confidence structural priors based on dominant
real-world model training practices. Leveraging these priors, our approach
enables accurate mapping of previously undocumented areas of the atlas. We
publicly release our datasets, code, and interactive atlas.

   title: Video-T1: Test-Time Scaling for Video Generation
   summary: With the scale capability of increasing training data, model size, and
computational cost, video generation has achieved impressive results in digital
creation, enabling users to express creativity across various domains.
Recently, researchers in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded the scaling
to test-time, which can significantly improve LLM performance by using more
inference-time computation. Instead of scaling up video foundation models
through expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling
(TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation
model is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much
can it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt. In this
work, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching
problem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target
video distribution. Specifically, we build the search space with test-time
verifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching
process. Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search
strategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. As full-step
denoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs,
we further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called
Tree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an
autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on text-conditioned video
generation benchmarks demonstrate that increasing test-time compute
consistently leads to significant improvements in the quality of videos.

   title: Phi-4-Mini Technical Report: Compact yet Powerful Multimodal Language
  Models via Mixture-of-LoRAs
   summary: We introduce Phi-4-Mini and Phi-4-Multimodal, compact yet highly capable
language and multimodal models. Phi-4-Mini is a 3.8-billion-parameter language
model trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly
outperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the
performance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex
reasoning. This achievement is driven by a carefully curated synthetic data
recipe emphasizing high-quality math and coding datasets. Compared to its
predecessor, Phi-3.5-Mini, Phi-4-Mini features an expanded vocabulary size of
200K tokens to better support multilingual applications, as well as group query
attention for more efficient long-sequence generation. Phi-4-Multimodal is a
multimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input
modalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages
LoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes
combining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks
first in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the
speech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal
supports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and
(speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language
models on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train
Phi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities. Despite its compact
3.8-billion-parameter size, this experimental version achieves reasoning
performance on par with or surpassing significantly larger models, including
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.

   title: LMM-R1: Empowering 3B LMMs with Strong Reasoning Abilities Through
  Two-Stage Rule-Based RL
   summary: Enhancing reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) faces unique challenges
from the complex interplay between visual perception and logical reasoning,
particularly in compact 3B-parameter architectures where architectural
constraints limit reasoning capacity and modality alignment.
  While rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) excels in text-only domains, its
multimodal extension confronts two critical barriers: (1) data limitations due
to ambiguous answers and scarce complex reasoning examples, and (2) degraded
foundational reasoning induced by multimodal pretraining.
  To address these challenges, we propose \method, a two-stage
framework adapting rule-based RL for multimodal reasoning through
Foundational Reasoning Enhancement (FRE) followed by
Multimodal Generalization Training (MGT). The FRE stage first
strengthens reasoning abilities using text-only data with rule-based RL, then
the MGT stage generalizes these reasoning capabilities to multimodal domains.
  Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct-3B demonstrate that \method achieves
4.83\% and 4.5\% average improvements over baselines in multimodal and
text-only benchmarks, respectively, with a 3.63\% gain in complex Football Game
tasks. These results validate that text-based reasoning enhancement enables
effective multimodal generalization, offering a data-efficient paradigm that
bypasses costly high-quality multimodal training data.

   title: PLADIS: Pushing the Limits of Attention in Diffusion Models at Inference
  Time by Leveraging Sparsity
   summary: Diffusion models have shown impressive results in generating high-quality
conditional samples using guidance techniques such as Classifier-Free Guidance
(CFG). However, existing methods often require additional training or neural
function evaluations (NFEs), making them incompatible with guidance-distilled
models. Also, they rely on heuristic approaches that need identifying target
layers. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient method, termed PLADIS,
which boosts pre-trained models (U-Net/Transformer) by leveraging sparse
attention. Specifically, we extrapolate query-key correlations using softmax
and its sparse counterpart in the cross-attention layer during inference,
without requiring extra training or NFEs. By leveraging the noise robustness of
sparse attention, our PLADIS unleashes the latent potential of text-to-image
diffusion models, enabling them to excel in areas where they once struggled
with newfound effectiveness. It integrates seamlessly with guidance techniques,
including guidance-distilled models. Extensive experiments show notable
improvements in text alignment and human preference, offering a highly
efficient and universally applicable solution.

   title: Visual-RFT: Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
   summary: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in Large Reasoning Models like OpenAI o1
learns from feedback on its answers, which is especially useful in applications
when fine-tuning data is scarce. Recent open-source work like DeepSeek-R1
demonstrates that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward is one key
direction in reproducing o1. While the R1-style model has demonstrated success
in language models, its application in multi-modal domains remains
under-explored. This work introduces Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(Visual-RFT), which further extends the application areas of RFT on visual
tasks. Specifically, Visual-RFT first uses Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
to generate multiple responses containing reasoning tokens and final answers
for each input, and then uses our proposed visual perception verifiable reward
functions to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm such as
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We design different verifiable
reward functions for different perception tasks, such as the Intersection over
Union (IoU) reward for object detection. Experimental results on fine-grained
image classification, few-shot object detection, reasoning grounding, as well
as open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks show the competitive performance
and advanced generalization ability of Visual-RFT compared with Supervised
Fine-tuning (SFT). For example, Visual-RFT improves accuracy by 24.3% over
the baseline in one-shot fine-grained image classification with around 100
samples. In few-shot object detection, Visual-RFT also exceeds the baseline by
21.9 on COCO's two-shot setting and 15.4 on LVIS. Our Visual-RFT represents
a paradigm shift in fine-tuning LVLMs, offering a data-efficient, reward-driven
approach that enhances reasoning and adaptability for domain-specific tasks.

collaborate, and how they evolve over time, while also addressing evaluation
methodologies, tool applications, practical challenges, and diverse application
domains. By surveying the latest developments in this rapidly evolving field,

   title: EuroBERT: Scaling Multilingual Encoders for European Languages
   summary: General-purpose multilingual vector representations, used in retrieval,
regression and classification, are traditionally obtained from bidirectional
encoder models. Despite their wide applicability, encoders have been recently
overshadowed by advances in generative decoder-only models. However, many
innovations driving this progress are not inherently tied to decoders. In this
paper, we revisit the development of multilingual encoders through the lens of
these advances, and introduce EuroBERT, a family of multilingual encoders
covering European and widely spoken global languages. Our models outperform
existing alternatives across a diverse range of tasks, spanning multilingual
capabilities, mathematics, and coding, and natively supporting sequences of up
to 8,192 tokens. We also examine the design decisions behind EuroBERT, offering
insights into our dataset composition and training pipeline. We publicly
release the EuroBERT models, including intermediate training checkpoints,
together with our training framework.

   title: Video-R1: Reinforcing Video Reasoning in MLLMs
   summary: Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through
rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first
attempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for eliciting video reasoning
within multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL
training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary
challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the
scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we
first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal
information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on
video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training
process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-COT-165k for SFT cold start
and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data.
Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant
improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as
well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc.
Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 35.8% accuracy on video spatial reasoning
benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o. All
codes, models, data are released.

   title: CoSTAast: Cost-Sensitive Toolpath Agent for Multi-turn Image Editing
   summary: Text-to-image models like stable diffusion and DALLE-3 still struggle with
multi-turn image editing. We decompose such a task as an agentic workflow
(path) of tool use that addresses a sequence of subtasks by AI tools of varying
costs. Conventional search algorithms require expensive exploration to find
tool paths. While large language models (LLMs) possess prior knowledge of
subtask planning, they may lack accurate estimations of capabilities and costs
of tools to determine which to apply in each subtask. Can we combine the
strengths of both LLMs and graph search to find cost-efficient tool paths? We
propose a three-stage approach "CoSTA*" that leverages LLMs to create a subtask
tree, which helps prune a graph of AI tools for the given task, and then
conducts A* search on the small subgraph to find a tool path. To better balance
the total cost and quality, CoSTA* combines both metrics of each tool on every
subtask to guide the A* search. Each subtask's output is then evaluated by a
vision-language model (VLM), where a failure will trigger an update of the
tool's cost and quality on the subtask. Hence, the A* search can recover from
failures quickly to explore other paths. Moreover, CoSTA* can automatically
switch between modalities across subtasks for a better cost-quality trade-off.
We build a novel benchmark of challenging multi-turn image editing, on which
CoSTA* outperforms state-of-the-art image-editing models or agents in terms of
both cost and quality, and performs versatile trade-offs upon user preference.
   id: 2503.10613

   title: Stop Overthinking: A Survey on Efficient Reasoning for Large Language
  Models
   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex tasks. Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as
OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2
reasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences
improve performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due
to verbose and redundant outputs, known as the "overthinking phenomenon". In
this paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically
investigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient
reasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we
categorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based
efficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models
into more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning
models; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to
dynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input
prompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency
based on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control.
Additionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning
models, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and
discuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.

   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive versatility as general
purpose models. However, their broad applicability comes at a high-cost
computational overhead, particularly in auto-regressive decoding where each
step requires a forward pass. In domain-specific settings, general-purpose
capabilities are unnecessary and can be exchanged for efficiency. In this work,
we take a novel perspective on domain adaptation, reducing latency and
computational costs by adapting the vocabulary to focused domains of interest.
We introduce AdaptiVocab, an end-to-end approach for vocabulary adaptation,
designed to enhance LLM efficiency in low-resource domains. AdaptiVocab can be
applied to any tokenizer and architecture, modifying the vocabulary by
replacing tokens with domain-specific n-gram-based tokens, thereby reducing the
number of tokens required for both input processing and output generation.
AdaptiVocab initializes new n-token embeddings using an exponentially weighted
combination of existing embeddings and employs a lightweight fine-tuning phase
that can be efficiently performed on a single GPU. We evaluate two 7B LLMs
across three niche domains, assessing efficiency, generation quality, and
end-task performance. Our results show that AdaptiVocab reduces token usage by
over 25% without compromising performance

   title: Block Diffusion: Interpolating Between Autoregressive and Diffusion
  Language Models
   summary: Diffusion language models offer unique benefits over autoregressive models
due to their potential for parallelized generation and controllability, yet
they lag in likelihood modeling and are limited to fixed-length generation. In
this work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that
interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models.
Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting
flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching
and parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block
diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of
gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance.
Block diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models
on language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length
sequences. We provide the code, along with the model weights and blog post on
the project page: https://m-arriola.com/bd3lms/

   ai_summary: Block diffusion language models improve generation efficiency and sequence length flexibility compared to autoregressive and discrete denoising diffusion models.

   title: Long-Context Autoregressive Video Modeling with Next-Frame Prediction
   summary: Long-context autoregressive modeling has significantly advanced language
generation, but video generation still struggles to fully utilize extended
temporal contexts. To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce
Frame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive
modeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens
(i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous
frames, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion
transformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context vision modeling
faces challenges due to visual redundancy. Existing RoPE lacks effective
temporal decay for remote context and fails to extrapolate well to long video
sequences. Additionally, training on long videos is computationally expensive,
as vision tokens grow much faster than language tokens. To tackle these issues,
we propose balancing locality and long-range dependency. We introduce FlexRoPE,
an test-time technique that adds flexible temporal decay to RoPE, enabling
extrapolation to 16x longer vision contexts. Furthermore, we propose long
short-term context modeling, where a high-resolution short-term context window
ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an unlimited long-term context
window encodes long-range information using fewer tokens. With this approach,
we can train on long video sequences with a manageable token context length. We
demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and
long-video generation, providing a simple yet effective baseline for video
autoregressive modeling.
   id: 2503.19325
   ai_summary: FAR, an autoregressive video model, achieves state-of-the-art results by balancing locality and long-range context with FlexRoPE and long short-term context modeling, addressing challenges in long-context video generation.

   title: When Less is Enough: Adaptive Token Reduction for Efficient Image
  Representation
   summary: Vision encoders typically generate a large number of visual tokens, providing
information-rich representations but significantly increasing computational
demands. This raises the question of whether all generated tokens are equally
valuable or if some of them can be discarded to reduce computational costs
without compromising quality. In this paper, we introduce a new method for
determining feature utility based on the idea that less valuable features can
be reconstructed from more valuable ones. We implement this concept by
integrating an autoencoder with a Gumbel-Softmax selection mechanism, that
allows identifying and retaining only the most informative visual tokens. To
validate our approach, we compared the performance of the LLaVA-NeXT model,
using features selected by our method with randomly selected features. We found
that on OCR-based tasks, more than 50% of the visual context can be removed
with minimal performance loss, whereas randomly discarding the same proportion
of features significantly affects the model capabilities. Furthermore, in
general-domain tasks, even randomly retaining only 30% of tokens achieves
performance comparable to using the full set of visual tokens. Our results
highlight a promising direction towards adaptive and efficient multimodal
pruning that facilitates scalable and low-overhead inference without
compromising performance.

   title: LLMVoX: Autoregressive Streaming Text-to-Speech Model for Any LLM
   summary: Recent advancements in speech-to-speech dialogue systems leverage LLMs for
multimodal interactions, yet they remain hindered by fine-tuning requirements,
high computational overhead, and text-speech misalignment. Existing
speech-enabled LLMs often degrade conversational quality by modifying the LLM,
thereby compromising its linguistic capabilities. In contrast, we propose
LLMVoX, a lightweight 30M-parameter, LLM-agnostic, autoregressive streaming TTS
system that generates high-quality speech with low latency, while fully
preserving the capabilities of the base LLM. Our approach achieves a
significantly lower Word Error Rate compared to speech-enabled LLMs, while
operating at comparable latency and UTMOS score. By decoupling speech synthesis
from LLM processing via a multi-queue token streaming system, LLMVoX supports
seamless, infinite-length dialogues. Its plug-and-play design also facilitates
extension to various tasks with different backbones. Furthermore, LLMVoX
generalizes to new languages with only dataset adaptation, attaining a low
Character Error Rate on an Arabic speech task. Additionally, we have integrated
LLMVoX with a Vision-Language Model to create an omni-model with speech, text,
and vision capabilities, without requiring additional multimodal training. Our
code base and project page is available at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/LLMVoX .

   ai_summary: LLMVoX is a lightweight, LLM-agnostic TTS system that decouples speech synthesis from model processing, ensuring high-quality speech with low latency and supporting seamless multimodal dialogue.

   title: YuE: Scaling Open Foundation Models for Long-Form Music Generation
   summary: We tackle the task of long-form music generation--particularly the
challenging lyrics-to-song problem--by introducing YuE, a family of
open foundation models based on the LLaMA2 architecture. Specifically, YuE
scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while
maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal
melodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1)
track-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2)
structural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3)
a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In
addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation,
enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an
English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional
generation. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or
even surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility.
In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support
for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned
representations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the
results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE
benchmark. Keywords: lyrics2song, song generation, long-form, foundation model,

   title: Being-0: A Humanoid Robotic Agent with Vision-Language Models and
  Modular Skills
   summary: Building autonomous robotic agents capable of achieving human-level
performance in real-world embodied tasks is an ultimate goal in humanoid robot
research. Recent advances have made significant progress in high-level
cognition with Foundation Models (FMs) and low-level skill development for
humanoid robots. However, directly combining these components often results in
poor robustness and efficiency due to compounding errors in long-horizon tasks
and the varied latency of different modules. We introduce Being-0, a
hierarchical agent framework that integrates an FM with a modular skill
library. The FM handles high-level cognitive tasks such as instruction
understanding, task planning, and reasoning, while the skill library provides
stable locomotion and dexterous manipulation for low-level control. To bridge
the gap between these levels, we propose a novel Connector module, powered by a
lightweight vision-language model (VLM). The Connector enhances the FM's
embodied capabilities by translating language-based plans into actionable skill
commands and dynamically coordinating locomotion and manipulation to improve
task success. With all components, except the FM, deployable on low-cost
onboard computation devices, Being-0 achieves efficient, real-time performance
on a full-sized humanoid robot equipped with dexterous hands and active vision.
Extensive experiments in large indoor environments demonstrate Being-0's
effectiveness in solving complex, long-horizon tasks that require challenging
navigation and manipulation subtasks. For further details and videos, visit

   title: SEAP: Training-free Sparse Expert Activation Pruning Unlock the
  Brainpower of Large Language Models
   summary: Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success across various natural
language processing tasks, yet their high computational cost during inference
remains a major bottleneck. This paper introduces Sparse Expert Activation
Pruning (SEAP), a training-free pruning method that selectively retains
task-relevant parameters to reduce inference overhead. Inspired by the
clustering patterns of hidden states and activations in LLMs, SEAP identifies
task-specific expert activation patterns and prunes the model while preserving
task performance and enhancing computational efficiency. Experimental results
demonstrate that SEAP significantly reduces computational overhead while
maintaining competitive accuracy. Notably, at 50% pruning, SEAP surpasses both
WandA and FLAP by over 20%, and at 20% pruning, it incurs only a 2.2%
performance drop compared to the dense model. These findings highlight SEAP's
scalability and effectiveness, making it a promising approach for optimizing
large-scale LLMs.

   title: Babel: Open Multilingual Large Language Models Serving Over 90% of
  Global Speakers
   summary: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
(NLP), yet open-source multilingual LLMs remain scarce, with existing models
often limited in language coverage. Such models typically prioritize
well-resourced languages, while widely spoken but under-resourced languages are
often overlooked. To address this disparity, we introduce Babel, an
open multilingual LLM that covers the top 25 languages by number of speakers,
supports over 90% of the global population, and includes many languages
neglected by other open multilingual LLMs. Unlike traditional continue
pretraining approaches, Babel expands its parameter count through a layer
extension technique that elevates Babel's performance ceiling. We introduce two
variants: Babel-9B, designed for efficient inference and
fine-tuning, and Babel-83B, which sets a new standard for open
multilingual LLMs. Extensive evaluations on multilingual tasks demonstrate its
superior performance compared to open LLMs of comparable size. In addition,
using open-source supervised fine-tuning datasets, Babel achieves remarkable
performance, with Babel-9B-Chat leading among 10B-sized LLMs and Babel-83B-Chat
setting a new standard for multilingual tasks, reaching the same level of
commercial models.

   title: UI-R1: Enhancing Action Prediction of GUI Agents by Reinforcement
  Learning
   summary: The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities
in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards. Building
on this idea, we are the first to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the
reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for graphic
user interface (GUI) action prediction tasks. To this end, we curate a small
yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common
action types on mobile devices. We also introduce a unified rule-based action
reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed data-efficient model, UI-R1-3B, achieves substantial improvements on
both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks. Specifically, on the ID
benchmark AndroidControl, the action type accuracy improves by 15%, while
grounding accuracy increases by 10.3%, compared with the base model (i.e.
Qwen2.5-VL-3B). On the OOD GUI grounding benchmark ScreenSpot-Pro, our model
surpasses the base model by 6.0% and achieves competitive performance with
larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B), which are trained via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) on 76K data. These results underscore the potential of rule-based
reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way
for future research in this domain.

   title: Impossible Videos
   summary: Synthetic videos nowadays is widely used to complement data scarcity and
diversity of real-world videos. Current synthetic datasets primarily replicate
real-world scenarios, leaving impossible, counterfactual and anti-reality video
concepts underexplored. This work aims to answer two questions: 1) Can today's
video generation models effectively follow prompts to create impossible video
content? 2) Are today's video understanding models good enough for
understanding impossible videos? To this end, we introduce IPV-Bench, a novel
benchmark designed to evaluate and foster progress in video understanding and
generation. IPV-Bench is underpinned by a comprehensive taxonomy, encompassing
4 domains, 14 categories. It features diverse scenes that defy physical,
biological, geographical, or social laws. Based on the taxonomy, a prompt suite
is constructed to evaluate video generation models, challenging their prompt
following and creativity capabilities. In addition, a video benchmark is
curated to assess Video-LLMs on their ability of understanding impossible
videos, which particularly requires reasoning on temporal dynamics and world
knowledge. Comprehensive evaluations reveal limitations and insights for future
directions of video models, paving the way for next-generation video models.

   title: MM-Eureka: Exploring Visual Aha Moment with Rule-based Large-scale
  Reinforcement Learning
   summary: We present MM-Eureka, a multimodal reasoning model that successfully extends
large-scale rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal reasoning.
While rule-based RL has shown remarkable success in improving LLMs' reasoning
abilities in text domains, its application to multimodal settings has remained
challenging. Our work reproduces key characteristics of text-based RL systems
like DeepSeek-R1 in the multimodal space, including steady increases in
accuracy reward and response length, and the emergence of reflection behaviors.
We demonstrate that both instruction-tuned and pre-trained models can develop
strong multimodal reasoning capabilities through rule-based RL without
supervised fine-tuning, showing superior data efficiency compared to
alternative approaches. We open-source our complete pipeline to foster further
research in this area. We release all our codes, models, data, etc. at

   title: R1-Zero's "Aha Moment" in Visual Reasoning on a 2B Non-SFT Model
   summary: Recently DeepSeek R1 demonstrated how reinforcement learning with simple
rule-based incentives can enable autonomous development of complex reasoning in
large language models, characterized by the "aha moment", in which the model
manifest self-reflection and increased response length during training.
However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed
to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first
successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal
reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying
reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47%
accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and
exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts
and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct
models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations
include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning
trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting
reasoning capabilities. The project code is available at

advancements in generative capabilities through a series of innovations,
including our novel VAE, scalable pre-training strategies, large-scale data
curation, and automated evaluation metrics. These contributions collectively
enhance the model's performance and versatility. Specifically, Wan is
characterized by four key features: Leading Performance: The 14B model of Wan,
trained on a vast dataset comprising billions of images and videos,
demonstrates the scaling laws of video generation with respect to both data and
model size. It consistently outperforms the existing open-source models as well
as state-of-the-art commercial solutions across multiple internal and external
benchmarks, demonstrating a clear and significant performance superiority.
Comprehensiveness: Wan offers two capable models, i.e., 1.3B and 14B

efficiency, requiring only 8.19 GB VRAM, making it compatible with a wide range
of consumer-grade GPUs. Openness: We open-source the entire series of Wan,

the video generation community. This openness seeks to significantly expand the
creative possibilities of video production in the industry and provide academia

   title: Inside-Out: Hidden Factual Knowledge in LLMs
   summary: This work presents a framework for assessing whether large language models
(LLMs) encode more factual knowledge in their parameters than what they express
in their outputs. While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has
clearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal
definition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of
correct-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This
gives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information
used to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable
token-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge
arises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a
case study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a
closed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode
more factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an
average gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply hidden that a
model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to generate it even
once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers. This reveals
fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs, which (3) puts
a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated answer
sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain
inaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they
were, we would be guaranteed to rank them first.

   title: VACE: All-in-One Video Creation and Editing
   summary: Diffusion Transformer has demonstrated powerful capability and scalability in
generating high-quality images and videos. Further pursuing the unification of
generation and editing tasks has yielded significant progress in the domain of
image content creation. However, due to the intrinsic demands for consistency
across both temporal and spatial dynamics, achieving a unified approach for
video synthesis remains challenging. We introduce VACE, which enables users to
perform Video tasks within an All-in-one framework for Creation and Editing.
These tasks include reference-to-video generation, video-to-video editing, and
masked video-to-video editing. Specifically, we effectively integrate the
requirements of various tasks by organizing video task inputs, such as editing,
reference, and masking, into a unified interface referred to as the Video
Condition Unit (VCU). Furthermore, by utilizing a Context Adapter structure, we
inject different task concepts into the model using formalized representations
of temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing it to handle arbitrary video
synthesis tasks flexibly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the unified
model of VACE achieves performance on par with task-specific models across
various subtasks. Simultaneously, it enables diverse applications through
versatile task combinations. Project page:

   title: Predictive Data Selection: The Data That Predicts Is the Data That
  Teaches
   summary: Language model pretraining involves training on extensive corpora, where data
quality plays a pivotal role. In this work, we aim to directly estimate the
contribution of data during pretraining and select pretraining data in an
efficient manner. Specifically, we draw inspiration from recent findings
showing that compression efficiency (i.e., the normalized loss) of diverse
models on certain text correlates strongly with their downstream performance,
when the text domain aligns with the downstream benchmark (Huang et al., 2024).
Building on this observation, we hypothesize that data on which model losses
are predictive of downstream abilities also contribute effectively to learning.
To leverage this insight, we introduce data selection based on data's
Predictive strength (Preselect), a lightweight and efficient data selection
method that requires training and deploying only a fastText-based scorer.
Through comprehensive experiments with 1B and 3B parameter models, we
demonstrate that models trained on 30B tokens selected with PreSelect surpasses
the performance of a vanilla baseline trained on 300B tokens, achieving a 10x
reduction in compute requirements. Furthermore, PreSelect significantly
outperforms other competitive data selection baselines, such as DCLM and
FineWeb-Edu on a scale of 3B models trained on 100B tokens. We open-source our
trained data selection scorer along with the curated datasets at
https://github.com/hkust-nlp/PreSelect.

   title: World Modeling Makes a Better Planner: Dual Preference Optimization for
  Embodied Task Planning
   summary: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown promise
for embodied task planning, yet they struggle with fundamental challenges like
dependency constraints and efficiency. Existing approaches either solely
optimize action selection or leverage world models during inference,
overlooking the benefits of learning to model the world as a way to enhance
planning capabilities. We propose Dual Preference Optimization (D^2PO), a new
learning framework that jointly optimizes state prediction and action selection
through preference learning, enabling LVLMs to understand environment dynamics
for better planning. To automatically collect trajectories and stepwise
preference data without human annotation, we introduce a tree search mechanism
for extensive exploration via trial-and-error. Extensive experiments on
VoTa-Bench demonstrate that our D^2PO-based method significantly outperforms
existing methods and GPT-4o when applied to Qwen2-VL (7B), LLaVA-1.6 (7B), and
LLaMA-3.2 (11B), achieving superior task success rates with more efficient
execution paths.

   title: MAPS: A Multi-Agent Framework Based on Big Seven Personality and
  Socratic Guidance for Multimodal Scientific Problem Solving
   summary: Multimodal scientific problems (MSPs) involve complex issues that require the
integration of multiple modalities, such as text and diagrams, presenting a
significant challenge in artificial intelligence. While progress has been made
in addressing traditional scientific problems, MSPs still face two primary
issues: the challenge of multi-modal comprehensive reasoning in scientific
problem-solving and the lack of reflective and rethinking capabilities. To
address these issues, we introduce a Multi-Agent framework based on the Big
Seven Personality and Socratic guidance (MAPS). This framework employs seven
distinct agents that leverage feedback mechanisms and the Socratic method to
guide the resolution of MSPs. To tackle the first issue, we propose a
progressive four-agent solving strategy, where each agent focuses on a specific
stage of the problem-solving process. For the second issue, we introduce a
Critic agent, inspired by Socratic questioning, which prompts critical thinking
and stimulates autonomous learning. We conduct extensive experiments on the
EMMA, Olympiad, and MathVista datasets, achieving promising results that
outperform the current SOTA model by 15.84% across all tasks. Meanwhile, the
additional analytical experiments also verify the model's progress as well as
generalization ability.

   title: Gemma 3 Technical Report
   summary: We introduce Gemma 3, a multimodal addition to the Gemma family of
lightweight open models, ranging in scale from 1 to 27 billion parameters. This
version introduces vision understanding abilities, a wider coverage of
languages and longer context - at least 128K tokens. We also change the
architecture of the model to reduce the KV-cache memory that tends to explode
with long context. This is achieved by increasing the ratio of local to global
attention layers, and keeping the span on local attention short. The Gemma 3
models are trained with distillation and achieve superior performance to Gemma
2 for both pre-trained and instruction finetuned versions. In particular, our
novel post-training recipe significantly improves the math, chat,
instruction-following and multilingual abilities, making Gemma3-4B-IT
competitive with Gemma2-27B-IT and Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro

   title: GoT: Unleashing Reasoning Capability of Multimodal Large Language Model
  for Visual Generation and Editing
   summary: Current image generation and editing methods primarily process textual
prompts as direct inputs without reasoning about visual composition and
explicit operations. We present Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT), a novel
paradigm that enables generation and editing through an explicit language
reasoning process before outputting images. This approach transforms
conventional text-to-image generation and editing into a reasoning-guided
framework that analyzes semantic relationships and spatial arrangements. We
define the formulation of GoT and construct large-scale GoT datasets containing
over 9M samples with detailed reasoning chains capturing semantic-spatial
relationships. To leverage the advantages of GoT, we implement a unified
framework that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for reasoning chain generation with an
end-to-end diffusion model enhanced by our novel Semantic-Spatial Guidance
Module. Experiments show our GoT framework achieves excellent performance on
both generation and editing tasks, with significant improvements over
baselines. Additionally, our approach enables interactive visual generation,
allowing users to explicitly modify reasoning steps for precise image
adjustments. GoT pioneers a new direction for reasoning-driven visual
generation and editing, producing images that better align with human intent.
To facilitate future research, we make our datasets, code, and pretrained
models publicly available at https://github.com/rongyaofang/GoT.

   title: Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Small LLMs: What Works and What
  Doesn't
   summary: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
typically relies on massive computational resources and extensive datasets,
limiting accessibility for resource-constrained settings. Our study
investigates the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning
in small LLMs, focusing on a 1.5-billion-parameter model,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, under strict constraints: training on 4 NVIDIA
A40 GPUs (48 GB VRAM each) within 24 hours. Adapting the Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curating a compact, high-quality mathematical
reasoning dataset, we conducted three experiments to explore model behavior and
performance. Our results demonstrate rapid reasoning gains - e.g., AMC23
accuracy rising from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing
o1-preview - using only 7,000 samples and a $42 training cost, compared to
thousands of dollars for baseline models. However, challenges such as
optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged
training. These findings highlight the efficacy of RL-based fine-tuning for

   title: InternVL3: Exploring Advanced Training and Test-Time Recipes for
  Open-Source Multimodal Models
   summary: We introduce InternVL3, a significant advancement in the InternVL series
featuring a native multimodal pre-training paradigm. Rather than adapting a
text-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and
linguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora
during a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively
addresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in
conventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve
performance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position
encoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced
post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed
preference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies
alongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations
demonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of
multi-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the
MMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its
capabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models,
including ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also
maintaining strong pure-language proficiency. In pursuit of open-science
principles, we will publicly release both the training data and model weights
to foster further research and development in next-generation MLLMs.
   id: 2504.10479
   ai_summary: InternVL3 is a multimodal pre-trained language model that jointly learns from both multimodal data and text, improving performance and scalability through advanced techniques and setting a new state-of-the-art in multimodal tasks.

   title: Advances and Challenges in Foundation Agents: From Brain-Inspired
  Intelligence to Evolutionary, Collaborative, and Safe Systems
   summary: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a transformative
shift in artificial intelligence, paving the way for advanced intelligent
agents capable of sophisticated reasoning, robust perception, and versatile
action across diverse domains. As these agents increasingly drive AI research
and practical applications, their design, evaluation, and continuous
improvement present intricate, multifaceted challenges. This survey provides a
comprehensive overview, framing intelligent agents within a modular,
brain-inspired architecture that integrates principles from cognitive science,
neuroscience, and computational research. We structure our exploration into
four interconnected parts. First, we delve into the modular foundation of
intelligent agents, systematically mapping their cognitive, perceptual, and
operational modules onto analogous human brain functionalities, and elucidating
core components such as memory, world modeling, reward processing, and
emotion-like systems. Second, we discuss self-enhancement and adaptive
evolution mechanisms, exploring how agents autonomously refine their
capabilities, adapt to dynamic environments, and achieve continual learning
through automated optimization paradigms, including emerging AutoML and
LLM-driven optimization strategies. Third, we examine collaborative and
evolutionary multi-agent systems, investigating the collective intelligence
emerging from agent interactions, cooperation, and societal structures,
highlighting parallels to human social dynamics. Finally, we address the
critical imperative of building safe, secure, and beneficial AI systems,
emphasizing intrinsic and extrinsic security threats, ethical alignment,
robustness, and practical mitigation strategies necessary for trustworthy
real-world deployment.

   title: SmolVLM: Redefining small and efficient multimodal models
   summary: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deliver exceptional performance but
require significant computational resources, limiting their deployment on
mobile and edge devices. Smaller VLMs typically mirror design choices of larger
models, such as extensive image tokenization, leading to inefficient GPU memory
usage and constrained practicality for on-device applications.
  We introduce SmolVLM, a series of compact multimodal models specifically
engineered for resource-efficient inference. We systematically explore
architectural configurations, tokenization strategies, and data curation
optimized for low computational overhead. Through this, we identify key design
choices that yield substantial performance gains on image and video tasks with
minimal memory footprints.
  Our smallest model, SmolVLM-256M, uses less than 1GB GPU memory during
inference and outperforms the 300-times larger Idefics-80B model, despite an
18-month development gap. Our largest model, at 2.2B parameters, rivals
state-of-the-art VLMs consuming twice the GPU memory. SmolVLM models extend
beyond static images, demonstrating robust video comprehension capabilities.
  Our results emphasize that strategic architectural optimizations, aggressive
yet efficient tokenization, and carefully curated training data significantly
enhance multimodal performance, facilitating practical, energy-efficient
deployments at significantly smaller scales.

   title: OmniSVG: A Unified Scalable Vector Graphics Generation Model
   summary: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an important image format widely adopted in
graphic design because of their resolution independence and editability. The
study of generating high-quality SVG has continuously drawn attention from both
designers and researchers in the AIGC community. However, existing methods
either produces unstructured outputs with huge computational cost or is limited
to generating monochrome icons of over-simplified structures. To produce
high-quality and complex SVG, we propose OmniSVG, a unified framework that
leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for end-to-end multimodal
SVG generation. By parameterizing SVG commands and coordinates into discrete
tokens, OmniSVG decouples structural logic from low-level geometry for
efficient training while maintaining the expressiveness of complex SVG
structure. To further advance the development of SVG synthesis, we introduce
MMSVG-2M, a multimodal dataset with two million richly annotated SVG assets,
along with a standardized evaluation protocol for conditional SVG generation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniSVG outperforms existing methods and
demonstrates its potential for integration into professional SVG design
workflows.
   id: 2504.06263
   ai_summary: OmniSVG, using pre-trained Vision-Language Models and discrete tokenization, generates high-quality SVGs efficiently with a large, multimodal dataset.

   title: Towards Understanding Camera Motions in Any Video
   summary: We introduce CameraBench, a large-scale dataset and benchmark designed to
assess and improve camera motion understanding. CameraBench consists of ~3,000
diverse internet videos, annotated by experts through a rigorous multi-stage
quality control process. One of our contributions is a taxonomy of camera
motion primitives, designed in collaboration with cinematographers. We find,
for example, that some motions like "follow" (or tracking) require
understanding scene content like moving subjects. We conduct a large-scale
human study to quantify human annotation performance, revealing that domain
expertise and tutorial-based training can significantly enhance accuracy. For
example, a novice may confuse zoom-in (a change of intrinsics) with translating
forward (a change of extrinsics), but can be trained to differentiate the two.
Using CameraBench, we evaluate Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Video-Language
Models (VLMs), finding that SfM models struggle to capture semantic primitives
that depend on scene content, while VLMs struggle to capture geometric
primitives that require precise estimation of trajectories. We then fine-tune a
generative VLM on CameraBench to achieve the best of both worlds and showcase
its applications, including motion-augmented captioning, video question
answering, and video-text retrieval. We hope our taxonomy, benchmark, and
tutorials will drive future efforts towards the ultimate goal of understanding
camera motions in any video.
   id: 2504.15376
   ai_summary: CameraBench assesses and enhances camera motion understanding by providing a large-scale dataset, taxonomy, and benchmark for evaluating SfM and VLMs, emphasizing the need for both semantic and geometric information.

   title: Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in
  LLMs Beyond the Base Model?
   summary: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently
demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs,
particularly in mathematics and programming tasks. It is widely believed that
RLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning
abilities that exceed corresponding base models' capacity. In this study,
however, we critically re-examines this assumption by measuring the
pass@k metric with large values of k to explore the reasoning
capability boundary of the models across a wide range of model families and
benchmarks. Surprisingly, the RL does not, in fact, elicit fundamentally
new reasoning patterns. While RL-trained models outperform their base models at
smaller values of k (\eg, k=1), base models can achieve a comparable or
even higher pass@k score compared to their RL counterparts at large k
values. The reasoning paths generated by RL-trained models are already included
in the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that most reasoning
abilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models.
Further analysis shows that RL training boosts the performance by biasing the
model's output distribution toward paths that are more likely to yield rewards,
therefore sampling correct responses more efficiently. But this also results in
a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. Similar
results are observed in visual reasoning tasks trained with RLVR. Moreover, we
find that distillation can genuinely introduce new knowledge into the model,
different from RLVR. These findings underscore a critical limitation of RLVR in
advancing LLM reasoning abilities which requires us to fundamentally rethink
the impact of RL training in reasoning LLMs and the need of a better paradigm.

   ai_summary: Despite initial claims, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards does not introduce fundamentally new reasoning abilities to LLMs, instead it enhances performance by biasing output distribution toward rewarded paths without expanding the reasoning boundary.

   title: MoCha: Towards Movie-Grade Talking Character Synthesis
   summary: Recent advancements in video generation have achieved impressive motion
realism, yet they often overlook character-driven storytelling, a crucial task
for automated film, animation generation. We introduce Talking Characters, a
more realistic task to generate talking character animations directly from
speech and text. Unlike talking head, Talking Characters aims at generating the
full portrait of one or more characters beyond the facial region. In this
paper, we propose MoCha, the first of its kind to generate talking characters.
To ensure precise synchronization between video and speech, we propose a
speech-video window attention mechanism that effectively aligns speech and
video tokens. To address the scarcity of large-scale speech-labeled video
datasets, we introduce a joint training strategy that leverages both
speech-labeled and text-labeled video data, significantly improving
generalization across diverse character actions. We also design structured
prompt templates with character tags, enabling, for the first time,
multi-character conversation with turn-based dialogue-allowing AI-generated
characters to engage in context-aware conversations with cinematic coherence.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including human preference
studies and benchmark comparisons, demonstrate that MoCha sets a new standard
for AI-generated cinematic storytelling, achieving superior realism,
expressiveness, controllability and generalization.

   title: PRIMA.CPP: Speeding Up 70B-Scale LLM Inference on Low-Resource Everyday
  Home Clusters
   summary: Emergency of DeepSeek R1 and QwQ 32B have broken through performance barriers
for running frontier large language models (LLMs) on home devices. While
consumer hardware is getting stronger and model quantization is improving,
existing end-side solutions still demand GPU clusters, large RAM/VRAM, and high
bandwidth, far beyond what a common home cluster can handle. This paper
introduces prima.cpp, a distributed inference system that runs 70B-scale models
on everyday home devices using a mix of CPU/GPU, low RAM/VRAM, Wi-Fi, and
cross-platform support. It uses mmap to manage model weights and introduces
piped-ring parallelism with prefetching to hide disk loading. By modeling
heterogeneity in computation, communication, disk, memory (and its management
behavior), and OS, it optimally assigns model layers to each device's CPU and
GPU, further reducing token latency. An elegant algorithm named Halda is
proposed to solve this NP-hard assignment problem. We evaluate prima.cpp on a
common four-node home cluster. It outperforms llama.cpp, exo, and dllama on
30B+ models while keeping memory pressure below 6%. This brings frontier
30B-70B models, such as Llama 3, DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5, and QwQ to home
assistants, making advanced AI truly accessible to individuals. The code is
open source and available at https://github.com/Lizonghang/prima.cpp.

   title: Kimi-VL Technical Report
   summary: We present Kimi-VL, an efficient open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
vision-language model (VLM) that offers advanced multimodal reasoning,
long-context understanding, and strong agent capabilities - all while
activating only 2.8B parameters in its language decoder (Kimi-VL-A3B). Kimi-VL
demonstrates strong performance across challenging domains: as a
general-purpose VLM, Kimi-VL excels in multi-turn agent tasks (e.g., OSWorld),
matching flagship models. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable capabilities
across diverse challenging vision language tasks, including college-level image
and video comprehension, OCR, mathematical reasoning, and multi-image
understanding. In comparative evaluations, it effectively competes with
cutting-edge efficient VLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and
Gemma-3-12B-IT, while surpassing GPT-4o in several key domains. Kimi-VL also
advances in processing long contexts and perceiving clearly. With a 128K
extended context window, Kimi-VL can process diverse long inputs, achieving
impressive scores of 64.5 on LongVideoBench and 35.1 on MMLongBench-Doc. Its
native-resolution vision encoder, MoonViT, further allows it to see and
understand ultra-high-resolution visual inputs, achieving 83.2 on InfoVQA and
34.5 on ScreenSpot-Pro, while maintaining lower computational cost for common
tasks. Building upon Kimi-VL, we introduce an advanced long-thinking variant:
Kimi-VL-Thinking. Developed through long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), this model exhibits strong
long-horizon reasoning capabilities. It achieves scores of 61.7 on MMMU, 36.8
on MathVision, and 71.3 on MathVista while maintaining the compact 2.8B
activated LLM parameters, setting a new standard for efficient multimodal
thinking models. Code and models are publicly accessible at

   title: Seaweed-7B: Cost-Effective Training of Video Generation Foundation Model
   summary: This technical report presents a cost-efficient strategy for training a video
generation foundation model. We present a mid-sized research model with
approximately 7 billion parameters (7B) called Seaweed-7B trained from scratch
using 665,000 H100 GPU hours. Despite being trained with moderate computational
resources, Seaweed-7B demonstrates highly competitive performance compared to
contemporary video generation models of much larger size. Design choices are
especially crucial in a resource-constrained setting. This technical report
highlights the key design decisions that enhance the performance of the
medium-sized diffusion model. Empirically, we make two observations: (1)
Seaweed-7B achieves performance comparable to, or even surpasses, larger models
trained on substantially greater GPU resources, and (2) our model, which
exhibits strong generalization ability, can be effectively adapted across a
wide range of downstream applications either by lightweight fine-tuning or
continue training. See the project page at https://seaweed.video/

   title: Kuwain 1.5B: An Arabic SLM via Language Injection
   summary: Enhancing existing models with new knowledge is a crucial aspect of AI
development. This paper introduces a novel method for integrating a new
language into a large language model (LLM). Our approach successfully
incorporates a previously unseen target language into an existing LLM without
compromising its prior knowledge. We trained a tiny model with 1.5 billion
parameters named Kuwain by injecting the Arabic language into a small
open-source model mainly trained in English. Our method demonstrates
significant improvements in Arabic language performance, with an average 8%
improvement across various benchmarks, while retaining the model's existing
knowledge with a minimum amount of the original model's data. This offers a
cost-effective alternative to training a comprehensive model in both English
and Arabic. The results highlight the potential for efficient, targeted
language model expansion without extensive retraining or resource-intensive
processes.

   title: Paper2Code: Automating Code Generation from Scientific Papers in Machine
  Learning
   summary: Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code
implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for
researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work. In the meantime,
recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents
and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a
multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into
functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning,
where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with
diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files;
analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and
generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each
phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to
collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on
generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both
model-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper
authors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality,
faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the
recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by
substantial margins.

   title: TTRL: Test-Time Reinforcement Learning
   summary: This paper investigates Reinforcement Learning (RL) on data without explicit
labels for reasoning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs). The core challenge
of the problem is reward estimation during inference while not having access to
ground-truth information. While this setting appears elusive, we find that
common practices in Test-Time Scaling (TTS), such as majority voting, yield
surprisingly effective rewards suitable for driving RL training. In this work,
we introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), a novel method for
training LLMs using RL on unlabeled data. TTRL enables self-evolution of LLMs
by utilizing the priors in the pre-trained models. Our experiments demonstrate
that TTRL consistently improves performance across a variety of tasks and
models. Notably, TTRL boosts the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-Math-7B by
approximately 159% on the AIME 2024 with only unlabeled test data. Furthermore,
although TTRL is only supervised by the Maj@N metric, TTRL has demonstrated
performance to consistently surpass the upper limit of the initial model, and
approach the performance of models trained directly on test data with
ground-truth labels. Our experimental findings validate the general
effectiveness of TTRL across various tasks, and highlight TTRL's potential for
broader tasks and domains. GitHub: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/TTRL

   title: Hogwild! Inference: Parallel LLM Generation via Concurrent Attention
   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle
increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content
generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long
inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to
expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks,
exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown
that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation
frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent
sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks
may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their
applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM
"workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated
attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our
approach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy
for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's partial progress
in the concurrent cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a
parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in
parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's
generated tokens. Hogwild! inference takes advantage of Rotary Position
Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware
utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference
with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.

   title: One-Minute Video Generation with Test-Time Training
   summary: Transformers today still struggle to generate one-minute videos because
self-attention layers are inefficient for long context. Alternatives such as
Mamba layers struggle with complex multi-scene stories because their hidden
states are less expressive. We experiment with Test-Time Training (TTT) layers,
whose hidden states themselves can be neural networks, therefore more
expressive. Adding TTT layers into a pre-trained Transformer enables it to
generate one-minute videos from text storyboards. For proof of concept, we
curate a dataset based on Tom and Jerry cartoons. Compared to baselines such as
Mamba~2, Gated DeltaNet, and sliding-window attention layers, TTT layers
generate much more coherent videos that tell complex stories, leading by 34 Elo
points in a human evaluation of 100 videos per method. Although promising,
results still contain artifacts, likely due to the limited capability of the
pre-trained 5B model. The efficiency of our implementation can also be
improved. We have only experimented with one-minute videos due to resource
constraints, but the approach can be extended to longer videos and more complex
stories. Sample videos, code and annotations are available at:

   title: Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Large Language Models with One
  Training Example
   summary: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward using one training
example (1-shot RLVR) is effective in incentivizing the math reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Applying RLVR to the base model
Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance
on MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6%, and improves the average performance across six
common mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7%. This result
matches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500:
73.6%, average: 35.9%), which includes the aforementioned example. Similar
substantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B,
Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and
PPO), and different math examples (many of which yield approximately 30% or
greater improvement on MATH500 when employed as a single training example). In
addition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including
cross-domain generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and
sustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has
saturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we
verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy
gradient loss, distinguishing it from the "grokking" phenomenon. We also show
the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by adding entropy loss with
an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. As a bonus, we observe
that applying entropy loss alone, without any outcome reward, significantly
enhances Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B's performance on MATH500 by 27.4%. These findings
can inspire future work on RLVR data efficiency and encourage a re-examination
of both recent progress and the underlying mechanisms in RLVR. Our code, model,
and data are open source at https://github.com/ypwang61/One-Shot-RLVR

   title: MergeVQ: A Unified Framework for Visual Generation and Representation
  with Disentangled Token Merging and Quantization
   summary: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with Vector Quantization (VQ) has achieved great
success in both self-supervised pre-training and image generation. However,
most existing methods struggle to address the trade-off in shared latent space
for generation quality vs. representation learning and efficiency. To push the
limits of this paradigm, we propose MergeVQ, which incorporates token merging
techniques into VQ-based generative models to bridge the gap between image
generation and visual representation learning in a unified architecture. During
pre-training, MergeVQ decouples top-k semantics from latent space with the
token merge module after self-attention blocks in the encoder for subsequent
Look-up Free Quantization (LFQ) and global alignment and recovers their
fine-grained details through cross-attention in the decoder for reconstruction.
As for the second-stage generation, we introduce MergeAR, which performs KV
Cache compression for efficient raster-order prediction. Extensive experiments
on ImageNet verify that MergeVQ as an AR generative model achieves competitive
performance in both visual representation learning and image generation tasks
while maintaining favorable token efficiency and inference speed. The code and
model will be available at https://apexgen-x.github.io/MergeVQ.

   title: TextCrafter: Accurately Rendering Multiple Texts in Complex Visual
  Scenes
   summary: This paper explores the task of Complex Visual Text Generation (CVTG), which
centers on generating intricate textual content distributed across diverse
regions within visual images. In CVTG, image generation models often rendering
distorted and blurred visual text or missing some visual text. To tackle these
challenges, we propose TextCrafter, a novel multi-visual text rendering method.
TextCrafter employs a progressive strategy to decompose complex visual text
into distinct components while ensuring robust alignment between textual
content and its visual carrier. Additionally, it incorporates a token focus
enhancement mechanism to amplify the prominence of visual text during the
generation process. TextCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in CVTG
tasks, such as text confusion, omissions, and blurriness. Moreover, we present
a new benchmark dataset, CVTG-2K, tailored to rigorously evaluate the
performance of generative models on CVTG tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

   title: CLIMB: CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping for
  Language Model Pre-training
   summary: Pre-training datasets are typically collected from web content and lack
inherent domain divisions. For instance, widely used datasets like Common Crawl
do not include explicit domain labels, while manually curating labeled datasets
such as The Pile is labor-intensive. Consequently, identifying an optimal
pre-training data mixture remains a challenging problem, despite its
significant benefits for pre-training performance. To address these challenges,
we propose CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping (CLIMB), an
automated framework that discovers, evaluates, and refines data mixtures in a
pre-training setting. Specifically, CLIMB embeds and clusters large-scale
datasets in a semantic space and then iteratively searches for optimal mixtures
using a smaller proxy model and a predictor. When continuously trained on 400B
tokens with this mixture, our 1B model exceeds the state-of-the-art
Llama-3.2-1B by 2.0%. Moreover, we observe that optimizing for a specific
domain (e.g., Social Sciences) yields a 5% improvement over random sampling.
Finally, we introduce ClimbLab, a filtered 1.2-trillion-token corpus with 20
clusters as a research playground, and ClimbMix, a compact yet powerful
400-billion-token dataset designed for efficient pre-training that delivers
superior performance under an equal token budget. We analyze the final data
mixture, elucidating the characteristics of an optimal data mixture. Our data

   title: Step1X-Edit: A Practical Framework for General Image Editing
   summary: In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid
development. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as
GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing
capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a
vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant
advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large
gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in
this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called
Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source
models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the
Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing
instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a
diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we
build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For
evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world
user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that
Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin
and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making
significant contributions to the field of image editing.

   summary: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) demonstrate that
sophisticated behaviors such as multi-step reasoning and self-reflection can
emerge via reinforcement learning (RL) with simple rule-based rewards. However,
existing zero-RL approaches are inherently ``on-policy'', limiting learning to
a model's own outputs and failing to acquire reasoning abilities beyond its
initial capabilities. We introduce LUFFY (Learning to reason Under oFF-policY
guidance), a framework that augments zero-RL with off-policy reasoning traces.
LUFFY dynamically balances imitation and exploration by combining off-policy
demonstrations with on-policy rollouts during training. Notably, we propose
policy shaping via regularized importance sampling to avoid superficial and
rigid imitation during mixed-policy training. Remarkably, LUFFY achieves an
over +7.0 average gain across six math benchmarks and an advantage of over +6.2
points in out-of-distribution tasks. It also substantially surpasses
imitation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT), particularly in generalization.
Analysis shows LUFFY not only imitates effectively but also explores beyond
demonstrations, offering a scalable path to train generalizable reasoning
models with off-policy guidance.

   ai_summary: LUFFY enhances zero-RL models with off-policy guidance, improving reasoning and generalization through balanced imitation and exploration.

   title: ZClip: Adaptive Spike Mitigation for LLM Pre-Training
   summary: Training large language models (LLMs) presents numerous challenges, including
gradient instability and loss spikes. These phenomena can lead to catastrophic
divergence, requiring costly checkpoint restoration and data batch skipping.
Traditional gradient clipping techniques, such as constant or norm-based
methods, fail to address these issues effectively due to their reliance on
fixed thresholds or heuristics, leading to inefficient learning and requiring
frequent manual intervention. In this work, we propose ZClip, an adaptive
gradient clipping algorithm that dynamically adjusts the clipping threshold
based on statistical properties of gradient norms over time. Unlike prior
reactive strategies, ZClip proactively adapts to training dynamics without
making any prior assumptions on the scale and the temporal evolution of
gradient norms. At its core, it leverages z-score-based anomaly detection to
identify and mitigate large gradient spikes, preventing malignant loss spikes
while not interfering with convergence otherwise. Our code is available at:
https://github.com/bluorion-com/ZClip.

   ai_summary: ZClip is an adaptive gradient clipping algorithm that uses z-score-based anomaly detection to dynamically adjust clipping thresholds and prevent large gradient spikes during LLM training.

   title: DeepSeek-R1 Thoughtology: Let's <think> about LLM Reasoning
   summary: Large Reasoning Models like DeepSeek-R1 mark a fundamental shift in how LLMs
approach complex problems. Instead of directly producing an answer for a given
input, DeepSeek-R1 creates detailed multi-step reasoning chains, seemingly
"thinking" about a problem before providing an answer. This reasoning process
is publicly available to the user, creating endless opportunities for studying
the reasoning behaviour of the model and opening up the field of Thoughtology.
Starting from a taxonomy of DeepSeek-R1's basic building blocks of reasoning,
our analyses on DeepSeek-R1 investigate the impact and controllability of
thought length, management of long or confusing contexts, cultural and safety
concerns, and the status of DeepSeek-R1 vis-\`a-vis cognitive phenomena, such
as human-like language processing and world modelling. Our findings paint a
nuanced picture. Notably, we show DeepSeek-R1 has a 'sweet spot' of reasoning,
where extra inference time can impair model performance. Furthermore, we find a
tendency for DeepSeek-R1 to persistently ruminate on previously explored
problem formulations, obstructing further exploration. We also note strong
safety vulnerabilities of DeepSeek-R1 compared to its non-reasoning
counterpart, which can also compromise safety-aligned LLMs.
   id: 2504.07128
   ai_summary: DeepSeek-R1 generates detailed reasoning chains, offering insights into model behavior and cognitive phenomena, with findings highlighting performance nuances and safety concerns.

   title: xVerify: Efficient Answer Verifier for Reasoning Model Evaluations
   summary: With the release of the o1 model by OpenAI, reasoning models adopting slow
thinking strategies have gradually emerged. As the responses generated by such
models often include complex reasoning, intermediate steps, and
self-reflection, existing evaluation methods are often inadequate. They
struggle to determine whether the LLM output is truly equivalent to the
reference answer, and also have difficulty identifying and extracting the final
answer from long, complex responses. To address this issue, we propose xVerify,
an efficient answer verifier for reasoning model evaluations. xVerify
demonstrates strong capability in equivalence judgment, enabling it to
effectively determine whether the answers produced by reasoning models are
equivalent to reference answers across various types of objective questions. To
train and evaluate xVerify, we construct the VAR dataset by collecting
question-answer pairs generated by multiple LLMs across various datasets,
leveraging multiple reasoning models and challenging evaluation sets designed
specifically for reasoning model assessment. A multi-round annotation process
is employed to ensure label accuracy. Based on the VAR dataset, we train
multiple xVerify models of different scales. In evaluation experiments
conducted on both the test set and generalization set, all xVerify models
achieve overall F1 scores and accuracy exceeding 95\%. Notably, the smallest
variant, xVerify-0.5B-I, outperforms all evaluation methods except GPT-4o,
while xVerify-3B-Ib surpasses GPT-4o in overall performance. These results
validate the effectiveness and generalizability of xVerify.

   ai_summary: xVerify, an efficient answer verifier, demonstrates strong equivalence judgment capabilities in evaluating reasoning models across various objective questions, with F1 scores and accuracy surpassing other methods.

   title: Skywork R1V: Pioneering Multimodal Reasoning with Chain-of-Thought
   summary: We introduce Skywork R1V, a multimodal reasoning model extending the an
R1-series Large language models (LLM) to visual modalities via an efficient
multimodal transfer method. Leveraging a lightweight visual projector, Skywork
R1V facilitates seamless multimodal adaptation without necessitating retraining
of either the foundational language model or the vision encoder. To strengthen
visual-text alignment, we propose a hybrid optimization strategy that combines
Iterative Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), significantly enhancing cross-modal integration efficiency.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive-length Chain-of-Thought distillation
approach for reasoning data generation. This approach dynamically optimizes
reasoning chain lengths, thereby enhancing inference efficiency and preventing
excessive reasoning overthinking. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
Skywork R1V, with only 38B parameters, delivers competitive performance,
achieving a score of 69.0 on the MMMU benchmark and 67.5 on MathVista.
Meanwhile, it maintains robust textual reasoning performance, evidenced by
impressive scores of 72.0 on AIME and 94.0 on MATH500. The Skywork R1V model
weights have been publicly released to promote openness and reproducibility.

   summary: We introduce BitNet b1.58 2B4T, the first open-source, native 1-bit Large
Language Model (LLM) at the 2-billion parameter scale. Trained on a corpus of 4
trillion tokens, the model has been rigorously evaluated across benchmarks
covering language understanding, mathematical reasoning, coding proficiency,
and conversational ability. Our results demonstrate that BitNet b1.58 2B4T
achieves performance on par with leading open-weight, full-precision LLMs of
similar size, while offering significant advantages in computational
efficiency, including substantially reduced memory footprint, energy
consumption, and decoding latency. To facilitate further research and adoption,
the model weights are released via Hugging Face along with open-source
inference implementations for both GPU and CPU architectures.

   title: VisuLogic: A Benchmark for Evaluating Visual Reasoning in Multi-modal
  Large Language Models
   summary: Visual reasoning is a core component of human intelligence and a critical
capability for advanced multimodal models. Yet current reasoning evaluations of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often rely on text descriptions and
allow language-based reasoning shortcuts, failing to measure genuine
vision-centric reasoning. To address this, we introduce VisuLogic: a benchmark
of 1,000 human-verified problems across six categories (e.g., quantitative
shifts, spatial relations, attribute comparisons). These various types of
questions can be evaluated to assess the visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs
from multiple perspectives. We evaluate leading MLLMs on this benchmark and
analyze their results to identify common failure modes. Most models score below
30% accuracy-only slightly above the 25% random baseline and far below the
51.4% achieved by humans-revealing significant gaps in visual reasoning.
Furthermore, we provide a supplementary training dataset and a
reinforcement-learning baseline to support further progress.
   id: 2504.15279
   ai_summary: VisuLogic is a benchmark to evaluate genuine vision-centric reasoning in multimodal large language models, revealing significant performance gaps compared to human accuracy.

   title: DDT: Decoupled Diffusion Transformer
   summary: Diffusion transformers have demonstrated remarkable generation quality,
albeit requiring longer training iterations and numerous inference steps. In
each denoising step, diffusion transformers encode the noisy inputs to extract
the lower-frequency semantic component and then decode the higher frequency
with identical modules. This scheme creates an inherent optimization dilemma:
encoding low-frequency semantics necessitates reducing high-frequency
components, creating tension between semantic encoding and high-frequency
decoding. To resolve this challenge, we propose a new
\color{ddtD}ecoupled \color{ddtD}iffusion
\color{ddtT}ransformer~(\color{ddtDDT}), with a decoupled
design of a dedicated condition encoder for semantic extraction alongside a
specialized velocity decoder. Our experiments reveal that a more substantial
encoder yields performance improvements as model size increases. For ImageNet
256times256, Our DDT-XL/2 achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of
{1.31 FID}~(nearly 4times faster training convergence compared to previous
diffusion transformers). For ImageNet 512times512, Our DDT-XL/2 achieves a
new state-of-the-art FID of 1.28. Additionally, as a beneficial by-product, our
decoupled architecture enhances inference speed by enabling the sharing
self-condition between adjacent denoising steps. To minimize performance
degradation, we propose a novel statistical dynamic programming approach to
identify optimal sharing strategies.
   id: 2504.05741
   ai_summary: A decoupled diffusion transformer improves performance and training speed in image generation by separating semantic extraction and high-frequency decoding.

   title: OLMoTrace: Tracing Language Model Outputs Back to Trillions of Training
  Tokens
   summary: We present OLMoTrace, the first system that traces the outputs of language
models back to their full, multi-trillion-token training data in real time.
OLMoTrace finds and shows verbatim matches between segments of language model
output and documents in the training text corpora. Powered by an extended
version of infini-gram (Liu et al., 2024), our system returns tracing results
within a few seconds. OLMoTrace can help users understand the behavior of
language models through the lens of their training data. We showcase how it can
be used to explore fact checking, hallucination, and the creativity of language
models. OLMoTrace is publicly available and fully open-source.

   title: Any2Caption:Interpreting Any Condition to Caption for Controllable Video
  Generation
   summary: To address the bottleneck of accurate user intent interpretation within the
current video generation community, we present Any2Caption, a novel framework
for controllable video generation under any condition. The key idea is to
decouple various condition interpretation steps from the video synthesis step.
By leveraging modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), Any2Caption
interprets diverse inputs--text, images, videos, and specialized cues such as
region, motion, and camera poses--into dense, structured captions that offer
backbone video generators with better guidance. We also introduce Any2CapIns, a
large-scale dataset with 337K instances and 407K conditions for
any-condition-to-caption instruction tuning. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate significant improvements of our system in controllability and video
quality across various aspects of existing video generation models. Project

   title: The Leaderboard Illusion
   summary: Measuring progress is fundamental to the advancement of any scientific field.
As benchmarks play an increasingly central role, they also grow more
susceptible to distortion. Chatbot Arena has emerged as the go-to leaderboard
for ranking the most capable AI systems. Yet, in this work we identify
systematic issues that have resulted in a distorted playing field. We find that
undisclosed private testing practices benefit a handful of providers who are
able to test multiple variants before public release and retract scores if
desired. We establish that the ability of these providers to choose the best
score leads to biased Arena scores due to selective disclosure of performance
results. At an extreme, we identify 27 private LLM variants tested by Meta in
the lead-up to the Llama-4 release. We also establish that proprietary closed
models are sampled at higher rates (number of battles) and have fewer models
removed from the arena than open-weight and open-source alternatives. Both
these policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time. Providers like
Google and OpenAI have received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the
arena, respectively. In contrast, a combined 83 open-weight models have only
received an estimated 29.7% of the total data. We show that access to Chatbot
Arena data yields substantial benefits; even limited additional data can result
in relative performance gains of up to 112% on the arena distribution, based on
our conservative estimates. Together, these dynamics result in overfitting to
Arena-specific dynamics rather than general model quality. The Arena builds on
the substantial efforts of both the organizers and an open community that
maintains this valuable evaluation platform. We offer actionable
recommendations to reform the Chatbot Arena's evaluation framework and promote
fairer, more transparent benchmarking for the field

   title: Seedream 3.0 Technical Report
   summary: We present Seedream 3.0, a high-performance Chinese-English bilingual image
generation foundation model. We develop several technical improvements to
address existing challenges in Seedream 2.0, including alignment with
complicated prompts, fine-grained typography generation, suboptimal visual
aesthetics and fidelity, and limited image resolutions. Specifically, the
advancements of Seedream 3.0 stem from improvements across the entire pipeline,
from data construction to model deployment. At the data stratum, we double the
dataset using a defect-aware training paradigm and a dual-axis collaborative
data-sampling framework. Furthermore, we adopt several effective techniques
such as mixed-resolution training, cross-modality RoPE, representation
alignment loss, and resolution-aware timestep sampling in the pre-training
phase. During the post-training stage, we utilize diversified aesthetic
captions in SFT, and a VLM-based reward model with scaling, thereby achieving
outputs that well align with human preferences. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0
pioneers a novel acceleration paradigm. By employing consistent noise
expectation and importance-aware timestep sampling, we achieve a 4 to 8 times
speedup while maintaining image quality. Seedream 3.0 demonstrates significant
improvements over Seedream 2.0: it enhances overall capabilities, in particular
for text-rendering in complicated Chinese characters which is important to
professional typography generation. In addition, it provides native
high-resolution output (up to 2K), allowing it to generate images with high
visual quality.

   title: AnimeGamer: Infinite Anime Life Simulation with Next Game State
  Prediction
   summary: Recent advancements in image and video synthesis have opened up new promise
in generative games. One particularly intriguing application is transforming
characters from anime films into interactive, playable entities. This allows
players to immerse themselves in the dynamic anime world as their favorite
characters for life simulation through language instructions. Such games are
defined as infinite game since they eliminate predetermined boundaries and
fixed gameplay rules, where players can interact with the game world through
open-ended language and experience ever-evolving storylines and environments.
Recently, a pioneering approach for infinite anime life simulation employs
large language models (LLMs) to translate multi-turn text dialogues into
language instructions for image generation. However, it neglects historical
visual context, leading to inconsistent gameplay. Furthermore, it only
generates static images, failing to incorporate the dynamics necessary for an
engaging gaming experience. In this work, we propose AnimeGamer, which is built
upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate each game state,
including dynamic animation shots that depict character movements and updates
to character states, as illustrated in Figure 1. We introduce novel
action-aware multimodal representations to represent animation shots, which can
be decoded into high-quality video clips using a video diffusion model. By
taking historical animation shot representations as context and predicting
subsequent representations, AnimeGamer can generate games with contextual
consistency and satisfactory dynamics. Extensive evaluations using both
automated metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that AnimeGamer outperforms
existing methods in various aspects of the gaming experience. Codes and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/TencentARC/AnimeGamer.

   title: Envisioning Beyond the Pixels: Benchmarking Reasoning-Informed Visual
  Editing
   summary: Large Multi-modality Models (LMMs) have made significant progress in visual
understanding and generation, but they still face challenges in General Visual
Editing, particularly in following complex instructions, preserving appearance
consistency, and supporting flexible input formats. To address this gap, we
introduce RISEBench, the first benchmark for evaluating Reasoning-Informed
viSual Editing (RISE). RISEBench focuses on four key reasoning types: Temporal,
Causal, Spatial, and Logical Reasoning. We curate high-quality test cases for
each category and propose an evaluation framework that assesses Instruction
Reasoning, Appearance Consistency, and Visual Plausibility with both human
judges and an LMM-as-a-judge approach. Our experiments reveal that while
GPT-4o-Native significantly outperforms other open-source and proprietary
models, even this state-of-the-art system struggles with logical reasoning
tasks, highlighting an area that remains underexplored. As an initial effort,
RISEBench aims to provide foundational insights into reasoning-aware visual
editing and to catalyze future research. Though still in its early stages, we
are committed to continuously expanding and refining the benchmark to support
more comprehensive, reliable, and scalable evaluations of next-generation
multimodal systems. Our code and data will be released at
https://github.com/PhoenixZ810/RISEBench.

   title: DreamActor-M1: Holistic, Expressive and Robust Human Image Animation
  with Hybrid Guidance
   summary: While recent image-based human animation methods achieve realistic body and
facial motion synthesis, critical gaps remain in fine-grained holistic
controllability, multi-scale adaptability, and long-term temporal coherence,
which leads to their lower expressiveness and robustness. We propose a
diffusion transformer (DiT) based framework, DreamActor-M1, with hybrid
guidance to overcome these limitations. For motion guidance, our hybrid control
signals that integrate implicit facial representations, 3D head spheres, and 3D
body skeletons achieve robust control of facial expressions and body movements,
while producing expressive and identity-preserving animations. For scale
adaptation, to handle various body poses and image scales ranging from
portraits to full-body views, we employ a progressive training strategy using
data with varying resolutions and scales. For appearance guidance, we integrate
motion patterns from sequential frames with complementary visual references,
ensuring long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions during complex
movements. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art works, delivering expressive results for portraits,
upper-body, and full-body generation with robust long-term consistency. Project

   title: Eagle 2.5: Boosting Long-Context Post-Training for Frontier
  Vision-Language Models
   summary: We introduce Eagle 2.5, a family of frontier vision-language models (VLMs)
for long-context multimodal learning. Our work addresses the challenges in long
video comprehension and high-resolution image understanding, introducing a
generalist framework for both tasks. The proposed training framework
incorporates Automatic Degrade Sampling and Image Area Preservation, two
techniques that preserve contextual integrity and visual details. The framework
also includes numerous efficiency optimizations in the pipeline for
long-context data training. Finally, we propose Eagle-Video-110K, a novel
dataset that integrates both story-level and clip-level annotations,
facilitating long-video understanding. Eagle 2.5 demonstrates substantial
improvements on long-context multimodal benchmarks, providing a robust solution
to the limitations of existing VLMs. Notably, our best model Eagle 2.5-8B
achieves 72.4% on Video-MME with 512 input frames, matching the results of
top-tier commercial model such as GPT-4o and large-scale open-source models
like Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B.

   title: Improved Visual-Spatial Reasoning via R1-Zero-Like Training
   summary: Increasing attention has been placed on improving the reasoning capacities of
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). As the cornerstone for AI agents
that function in the physical realm, video-based visual-spatial intelligence
(VSI) emerges as one of the most pivotal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This
work conducts a first, in-depth study on improving the visual-spatial reasoning
of MLLMs via R1-Zero-like training. Technically, we first identify that the
visual-spatial reasoning capacities of small- to medium-sized Qwen2-VL models
cannot be activated via Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts. We then incorporate
GRPO training for improved visual-spatial reasoning, using the carefully
curated VSI-100k dataset, following DeepSeek-R1-Zero. During the investigation,
we identify the necessity to keep the KL penalty (even with a small value) in
GRPO. With just 120 GPU hours, our vsGRPO-2B model, fine-tuned from
Qwen2-VL-2B, can outperform the base model by 12.1% and surpass GPT-4o.
Moreover, our vsGRPO-7B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-7B, achieves
performance comparable to that of the best open-source model
LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B. Additionally, we compare vsGRPO to supervised fine-tuning
and direct preference optimization baselines and observe strong performance
superiority. The code and dataset will be available soon.

   title: The Bitter Lesson Learned from 2,000+ Multilingual Benchmarks
   summary: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in linguistic
capabilities, robust multilingual evaluation has become essential for promoting
equitable technological progress. This position paper examines over 2,000
multilingual (non-English) benchmarks from 148 countries, published between
2021 and 2024, to evaluate past, present, and future practices in multilingual
benchmarking. Our findings reveal that, despite significant investments
amounting to tens of millions of dollars, English remains significantly
overrepresented in these benchmarks. Additionally, most benchmarks rely on
original language content rather than translations, with the majority sourced
from high-resource countries such as China, India, Germany, the UK, and the
USA. Furthermore, a comparison of benchmark performance with human judgments
highlights notable disparities. STEM-related tasks exhibit strong correlations
with human evaluations (0.70 to 0.85), while traditional NLP tasks like
question answering (e.g., XQuAD) show much weaker correlations (0.11 to 0.30).
Moreover, translating English benchmarks into other languages proves
insufficient, as localized benchmarks demonstrate significantly higher
alignment with local human judgments (0.68) than their translated counterparts
(0.47). This underscores the importance of creating culturally and
linguistically tailored benchmarks rather than relying solely on translations.
Through this comprehensive analysis, we highlight six key limitations in
current multilingual evaluation practices, propose the guiding principles
accordingly for effective multilingual benchmarking, and outline five critical
research directions to drive progress in the field. Finally, we call for a
global collaborative effort to develop human-aligned benchmarks that prioritize
real-world applications.

   title: An Empirical Study of GPT-4o Image Generation Capabilities
   summary: The landscape of image generation has rapidly evolved, from early GAN-based
approaches to diffusion models and, most recently, to unified generative
architectures that seek to bridge understanding and generation tasks. Recent
advances, especially the GPT-4o, have demonstrated the feasibility of
high-fidelity multimodal generation, their architectural design remains
mysterious and unpublished. This prompts the question of whether image and text
generation have already been successfully integrated into a unified framework
for those methods. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of GPT-4o's
image generation capabilities, benchmarking it against leading open-source and
commercial models. Our evaluation covers four main categories, including
text-to-image, image-to-image, image-to-3D, and image-to-X generation, with
more than 20 tasks. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of
GPT-4o under various settings, and situates it within the broader evolution of
generative modeling. Through this investigation, we identify promising
directions for future unified generative models, emphasizing the role of
architectural design and data scaling.

   title: Describe Anything: Detailed Localized Image and Video Captioning
   summary: Generating detailed and accurate descriptions for specific regions in images
and videos remains a fundamental challenge for vision-language models. We
introduce the Describe Anything Model (DAM), a model designed for detailed
localized captioning (DLC). DAM preserves both local details and global context
through two key innovations: a focal prompt, which ensures high-resolution
encoding of targeted regions, and a localized vision backbone, which integrates
precise localization with its broader context. To tackle the scarcity of
high-quality DLC data, we propose a Semi-supervised learning (SSL)-based Data
Pipeline (DLC-SDP). DLC-SDP starts with existing segmentation datasets and
expands to unlabeled web images using SSL. We introduce DLC-Bench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate DLC without relying on reference captions. DAM sets new
state-of-the-art on 7 benchmarks spanning keyword-level, phrase-level, and
detailed multi-sentence localized image and video captioning.

   title: ReTool: Reinforcement Learning for Strategic Tool Use in LLMs
   summary: While reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek R1) trained with reinforcement
learning (RL), excel in textual reasoning, they struggle in scenarios requiring
structured problem-solving, such as geometric reasoning, concise computation,
or complex equation solving-areas where computational tools like code
interpreters (CI) demonstrate distinct advantages. To bridge this gap, we
propose ReTool, which enhances long-form reasoning with tool-integrated
learning, including two key features: (1) dynamic interleaving of real-time
code execution within natural language reasoning processes, and (2) an
automated RL paradigm that allows policy rollouts with multi-turn real-time
code execution and teaches the model in learning when and how to invoke tools
based on outcome feedback. ReTool employs a systematic training framework,
beginning with synthetic cold-start data generation to produce code-augmented
long-form reasoning traces for fine-tuning base models. Subsequent RL training
leverages task outcomes as rewards to iteratively refine the model's tool use
strategy, enabling autonomous discovery of optimal tool invocation patterns
without human priors. Experiments on the challenging MATH Olympiad benchmark
AIME demonstrate ReTool's superiority: Our 32B model achieves 67% accuracy with
400 training steps, outperforming text-based RL baseline (40% accuracy, 1080
steps) in efficiency and performance. Remarkably, ReTool-32B attains 72.5%
accuracy in extended settings, surpassing OpenAI's o1-preview by 27.9%. Further
analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as code self-correction, signaling an
''aha moment'' in which the model autonomously masters adaptive tool use. These
findings highlight the promise of outcome-driven tool integration for advancing
complex mathematical reasoning and offer new insights into hybrid
neuro-symbolic systems.

   title: C3PO: Critical-Layer, Core-Expert, Collaborative Pathway Optimization
  for Test-Time Expert Re-Mixing
   summary: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from severely
sub-optimal expert pathways-our study reveals that naive expert selection
learned from pretraining leaves a surprising 10-20% accuracy gap for
improvement. Motivated by this observation, we develop a novel class of
test-time optimization methods to re-weight or "re-mixing" the experts in
different layers jointly for each test sample. Since the test sample's ground
truth is unknown, we propose to optimize a surrogate objective defined by the
sample's "successful neighbors" from a reference set of samples. We introduce
three surrogates and algorithms based on mode-finding, kernel regression, and
the average loss of similar reference samples/tasks. To reduce the cost of
optimizing whole pathways, we apply our algorithms merely to the core experts'
mixing weights in critical layers, which enjoy similar performance but save
significant computation. This leads to "Critical-Layer, Core-Expert,
Collaborative Pathway Optimization (C3PO)". We apply C3PO to two recent MoE
LLMs and examine it on six widely-used benchmarks. It consistently improves the
base model by 7-15% in accuracy and outperforms widely used test-time learning
baselines, e.g., in-context learning and prompt/prefix tuning, by a large
margin. Moreover, C3PO enables MoE LLMs with 1-3B active parameters to
outperform LLMs of 7-9B parameters, hence improving MoE's advantages on

   title: Open-Reasoner-Zero: An Open Source Approach to Scaling Up Reinforcement
  Learning on the Base Model
   summary: We introduce Open-Reasoner-Zero, the first open source implementation of
large-scale reasoning-oriented RL training focusing on scalability, simplicity
and accessibility. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
minimalist approach, vanilla PPO with GAE (lambda=1, gamma=1) and
straightforward rule-based rewards, without any KL regularization, is
sufficient to scale up both response length and benchmark performance, similar
to the phenomenon observed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Using the same base model as
DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B, our implementation achieves superior performance on
AIME2024, MATH500, and the GPQA Diamond benchmark while demonstrating
remarkable efficiency -- requiring only a tenth of the training steps, compared
to DeepSeek-R1-Zero pipeline. In the spirit of open source, we release our
source code, parameter settings, training data, and model weights across
various sizes.

   title: JudgeLRM: Large Reasoning Models as a Judge
   summary: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators offers a scalable
alternative to human annotation, yet existing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for
judges approaches often fall short in domains requiring complex reasoning. In
this work, we investigate whether LLM judges truly benefit from enhanced
reasoning capabilities. Through a detailed analysis of reasoning requirements
across evaluation tasks, we reveal a negative correlation between SFT
performance gains and the proportion of reasoning-demanding samples -
highlighting the limitations of SFT in such scenarios. To address this, we
introduce JudgeLRM, a family of judgment-oriented LLMs trained using
reinforcement learning (RL) with judge-wise, outcome-driven rewards. JudgeLRM
models consistently outperform both SFT-tuned and state-of-the-art reasoning
models. Notably, JudgeLRM-3B surpasses GPT-4, and JudgeLRM-7B outperforms
DeepSeek-R1 by 2.79% in F1 score, particularly excelling in judge tasks
requiring deep reasoning.

   title: UniversalRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Multiple Corpora with
  Diverse Modalities and Granularities
   summary: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown substantial promise in
improving factual accuracy by grounding model responses with external knowledge
relevant to queries. However, most existing RAG approaches are limited to a
text-only corpus, and while recent efforts have extended RAG to other
modalities such as images and videos, they typically operate over a single
modality-specific corpus. In contrast, real-world queries vary widely in the
type of knowledge they require, which a single type of knowledge source cannot
address. To address this, we introduce UniversalRAG, a novel RAG framework
designed to retrieve and integrate knowledge from heterogeneous sources with
diverse modalities and granularities. Specifically, motivated by the
observation that forcing all modalities into a unified representation space
derived from a single combined corpus causes a modality gap, where the
retrieval tends to favor items from the same modality as the query, we propose
a modality-aware routing mechanism that dynamically identifies the most
appropriate modality-specific corpus and performs targeted retrieval within it.
Also, beyond modality, we organize each modality into multiple granularity
levels, enabling fine-tuned retrieval tailored to the complexity and scope of
the query. We validate UniversalRAG on 8 benchmarks spanning multiple
modalities, showing its superiority over modality-specific and unified
baselines.
   id: 2504.20734
   ai_summary: UniversalRAG enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation by dynamically selecting and retrieving knowledge from various heterogeneous and modality-specific sources to improve factual accuracy across different types of queries.

   title: Antidistillation Sampling
   summary: Frontier models that generate extended reasoning traces inadvertently produce
rich token sequences that can facilitate model distillation. Recognizing this
vulnerability, model owners may seek sampling strategies that limit the
effectiveness of distillation without compromising model performance.
Antidistillation sampling provides exactly this capability. By
strategically modifying a model's next-token probability distribution,
antidistillation sampling poisons reasoning traces, rendering them
significantly less effective for distillation while preserving the model's
practical utility. For further details, see https://antidistillation.com.

   ai_summary: Antidistillation sampling modifies a model's next-token probability distribution to disrupt the generation of reasoning traces for distillation without affecting model performance.

   title: Understanding R1-Zero-Like Training: A Critical Perspective
   summary: DeepSeek-R1-Zero has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) at scale can
directly enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without supervised
fine-tuning. In this work, we critically examine R1-Zero-like training by
analyzing its two core components: base models and RL. We investigate a wide
range of base models, including DeepSeek-V3-Base, to understand how pretraining
characteristics influence RL performance. Our analysis reveals that
DeepSeek-V3-Base already exhibit ''Aha moment'', while Qwen2.5 base models
demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities even without prompt templates,
suggesting potential pretraining biases. Additionally, we identify an
optimization bias in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which
artificially increases response length (especially for incorrect outputs)
during training. To address this, we introduce Dr. GRPO, an unbiased
optimization method that improves token efficiency while maintaining reasoning
performance. Leveraging these insights, we present a minimalist R1-Zero recipe
that achieves 43.3% accuracy on AIME 2024 with a 7B base model, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Our code is available at
https://github.com/sail-sg/understand-r1-zero.

   title: GPT-ImgEval: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Diagnosing GPT4o in Image
  Generation
   summary: The recent breakthroughs in OpenAI's GPT4o model have demonstrated
surprisingly good capabilities in image generation and editing, resulting in
significant excitement in the community. This technical report presents the
first-look evaluation benchmark (named GPT-ImgEval), quantitatively and
qualitatively diagnosing GPT-4o's performance across three critical dimensions:
(1) generation quality, (2) editing proficiency, and (3) world
knowledge-informed semantic synthesis. Across all three tasks, GPT-4o
demonstrates strong performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in
both image generation control and output quality, while also showcasing
exceptional knowledge reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, based on the
GPT-4o's generated data, we propose a classification-model-based approach to
investigate the underlying architecture of GPT-4o, where our empirical results
suggest the model consists of an auto-regressive (AR) combined with a
diffusion-based head for image decoding, rather than the VAR-like
architectures. We also provide a complete speculation on GPT-4o's overall
architecture. In addition, we conduct a series of analyses to identify and
visualize GPT-4o's specific limitations and the synthetic artifacts commonly
observed in its image generation. We also present a comparative study of
multi-round image editing between GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, and discuss the
safety implications of GPT-4o's outputs, particularly their detectability by
existing image forensic models. We hope that our work can offer valuable
insight and provide a reliable benchmark to guide future research, foster
reproducibility, and accelerate innovation in the field of image generation and
beyond. The codes and datasets used for evaluating GPT-4o can be found at

   title: Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling
   summary: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted in post-training for
large language models (LLMs) at scale. Recently, the incentivization of
reasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that proper learning
methods could enable effective inference-time scalability. A key challenge of
RL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond
verifiable questions or artificial rules. In this work, we investigate how to
improve reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries,
i.e. the inference-time scalability of generalist RM, and further,
how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper
learning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward
modeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential
for inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled
Critique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs
through online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately,
resulting in DeepSeek-GRM models. Furthermore, for effective
inference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and
introduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance.
Empirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and
scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM
benchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared
to training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks,
which we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward
systems. The models will be released and open-sourced.

   title: Multi-Token Attention
   summary: Soft attention is a critical mechanism powering LLMs to locate relevant parts
within a given context. However, individual attention weights are determined by
the similarity of only a single query and key token vector. This "single token
attention" bottlenecks the amount of information used in distinguishing a
relevant part from the rest of the context. To address this issue, we propose a
new attention method, Multi-Token Attention (MTA), which allows LLMs to
condition their attention weights on multiple query and key vectors
simultaneously. This is achieved by applying convolution operations over
queries, keys and heads, allowing nearby queries and keys to affect each
other's attention weights for more precise attention. As a result, our method
can locate relevant context using richer, more nuanced information that can
exceed a single vector's capacity. Through extensive evaluations, we
demonstrate that MTA achieves enhanced performance on a range of popular
benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms Transformer baseline models on standard
language modeling tasks, and on tasks that require searching for information
within long contexts, where our method's ability to leverage richer information
proves particularly beneficial.

   title: Qwen3 Technical Report
   summary: In this work, we present Qwen3, the latest version of the Qwen model family.
Qwen3 comprises a series of large language models (LLMs) designed to advance
performance, efficiency, and multilingual capabilities. The Qwen3 series
includes models of both dense and Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architectures, with
parameter scales ranging from 0.6 to 235 billion. A key innovation in Qwen3 is
the integration of thinking mode (for complex, multi-step reasoning) and
non-thinking mode (for rapid, context-driven responses) into a unified
framework. This eliminates the need to switch between different models--such as
chat-optimized models (e.g., GPT-4o) and dedicated reasoning models (e.g.,
QwQ-32B)--and enables dynamic mode switching based on user queries or chat
templates. Meanwhile, Qwen3 introduces a thinking budget mechanism, allowing
users to allocate computational resources adaptively during inference, thereby
balancing latency and performance based on task complexity. Moreover, by
leveraging the knowledge from the flagship models, we significantly reduce the
computational resources required to build smaller-scale models, while ensuring
their highly competitive performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
Qwen3 achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks, including
tasks in code generation, mathematical reasoning, agent tasks, etc.,
competitive against larger MoE models and proprietary models. Compared to its
predecessor Qwen2.5, Qwen3 expands multilingual support from 29 to 119
languages and dialects, enhancing global accessibility through improved
cross-lingual understanding and generation capabilities. To facilitate
reproducibility and community-driven research and development, all Qwen3 models
are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

   title: Mutarjim: Advancing Bidirectional Arabic-English Translation with a
  Small Language Model
   summary: We introduce Mutarjim, a compact yet powerful language model for
bidirectional Arabic-English translation. While large-scale LLMs have shown
impressive progress in natural language processing tasks, including machine
translation, smaller models. Leveraging this insight, we developed Mutarjim
based on Kuwain-1.5B , a language model tailored for both Arabic and English.
Despite its modest size, Mutarjim outperforms much larger models on several
established benchmarks, achieved through an optimized two-phase training
approach and a carefully curated, high-quality training corpus.. Experimental
results show that Mutarjim rivals models up to 20 times larger while
significantly reducing computational costs and training requirements. We also
introduce Tarjama-25, a new benchmark designed to overcome limitations in
existing Arabic-English benchmarking datasets, such as domain narrowness, short
sentence lengths, and English-source bias. Tarjama-25 comprises 5,000
expert-reviewed sentence pairs and spans a wide range of domains, offering a
more comprehensive and balanced evaluation framework. Notably, Mutarjim
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English-to-Arabic task in
Tarjama-25, surpassing even significantly larger and proprietary models like
GPT-4o mini. We publicly release Tarjama-25 to support future research and
advance the evaluation of Arabic-English translation systems.

   title: Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data
   summary: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by learning
directly from outcome-based rewards. Recent RLVR works that operate under the
zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still
depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training.
The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the
long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already
evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a
hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by
humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To
address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in
which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning
progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any
external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner
(AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability
by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and
verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide
open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without
external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical
reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens
of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is
compatible with various model classes.

   title: Perception, Reason, Think, and Plan: A Survey on Large Multimodal
  Reasoning Models
   summary: Reasoning lies at the heart of intelligence, shaping the ability to make
decisions, draw conclusions, and generalize across domains. In artificial
intelligence, as systems increasingly operate in open, uncertain, and
multimodal environments, reasoning becomes essential for enabling robust and
adaptive behavior. Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a
promising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and
video to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve
comprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning. As
research advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular,
perception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer
more coherent cross-modal understanding. While instruction tuning and
reinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges
remain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior. To
address these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of
multimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental
roadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging
capabilities. First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules,
where reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation,
alignment, and fusion. Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning
into multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)
and multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured
reasoning chains. Finally, drawing on empirical insights from challenging
benchmarks and experimental cases of OpenAI O3 and O4-mini, we discuss the
conceptual direction of native large multimodal reasoning models (N-LMRMs),
which aim to support scalable, agentic, and adaptive reasoning and planning in
complex, real-world environments.

active parameters. Despite its relatively compact architecture, it delivers
strong performance across a wide spectrum of public VLM benchmarks and internal
evaluation suites, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on 38 out of 60
public benchmarks. Moreover, in agent-centric tasks such as GUI control and
gameplay, Seed1.5-VL outperforms leading multimodal systems, including OpenAI
CUA and Claude 3.7. Beyond visual and video understanding, it also demonstrates
strong reasoning abilities, making it particularly effective for multimodal
reasoning challenges such as visual puzzles. We believe these capabilities will
empower broader applications across diverse tasks. In this report, we mainly

   title: Shifting AI Efficiency From Model-Centric to Data-Centric Compression
   summary: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs
(MLLMs) has historically relied on model-centric scaling through increasing
parameter counts from millions to hundreds of billions to drive performance
gains. However, as we approach hardware limits on model size, the dominant
computational bottleneck has fundamentally shifted to the quadratic cost of
self-attention over long token sequences, now driven by ultra-long text
contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper,
we argue that the focus of research for efficient AI is shifting from
model-centric compression to data-centric compression. We position token
compression as the new frontier, which improves AI efficiency via reducing the
number of tokens during model training or inference. Through comprehensive
analysis, we first examine recent developments in long-context AI across
various domains and establish a unified mathematical framework for existing
model efficiency strategies, demonstrating why token compression represents a
crucial paradigm shift in addressing long-context overhead. Subsequently, we
systematically review the research landscape of token compression, analyzing
its fundamental benefits and identifying its compelling advantages across
diverse scenarios. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of current
challenges in token compression research and outline promising future
directions. Ultimately, our work aims to offer a fresh perspective on AI
efficiency, synthesize existing research, and catalyze innovative developments
to address the challenges that increasing context lengths pose to the AI
community's advancement.

   title: MiniMax-Speech: Intrinsic Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech with a Learnable
  Speaker Encoder
   summary: We introduce MiniMax-Speech, an autoregressive Transformer-based
Text-to-Speech (TTS) model that generates high-quality speech. A key innovation
is our learnable speaker encoder, which extracts timbre features from a
reference audio without requiring its transcription. This enables
MiniMax-Speech to produce highly expressive speech with timbre consistent with
the reference in a zero-shot manner, while also supporting one-shot voice
cloning with exceptionally high similarity to the reference voice. In addition,
the overall quality of the synthesized audio is enhanced through the proposed
Flow-VAE. Our model supports 32 languages and demonstrates excellent
performance across multiple objective and subjective evaluations metrics.
Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on objective voice cloning
metrics (Word Error Rate and Speaker Similarity) and has secured the top
position on the public TTS Arena leaderboard. Another key strength of
MiniMax-Speech, granted by the robust and disentangled representations from the
speaker encoder, is its extensibility without modifying the base model,
enabling various applications such as: arbitrary voice emotion control via
LoRA; text to voice (T2V) by synthesizing timbre features directly from text
description; and professional voice cloning (PVC) by fine-tuning timbre
features with additional data. We encourage readers to visit

   title: Emerging Properties in Unified Multimodal Pretraining
   summary: Unifying multimodal understanding and generation has shown impressive
capabilities in cutting-edge proprietary systems. In this work, we introduce
BAGEL, an open0source foundational model that natively supports multimodal

generation and understanding across standard benchmarks, while exhibiting
advanced multimodal reasoning abilities such as free-form image manipulation,
future frame prediction, 3D manipulation, and world navigation. In the hope of

   title: The Entropy Mechanism of Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning Language
  Models
   summary: This paper aims to overcome a major obstacle in scaling RL for reasoning with
LLMs, namely the collapse of policy entropy. Such phenomenon is consistently
observed across vast RL runs without entropy intervention, where the policy
entropy dropped sharply at the early training stage, this diminished
exploratory ability is always accompanied with the saturation of policy
performance. In practice, we establish a transformation equation R=-a*e^H+b
between entropy H and downstream performance R. This empirical law strongly
indicates that, the policy performance is traded from policy entropy, thus
bottlenecked by its exhaustion, and the ceiling is fully predictable H=0,
R=-a+b. Our finding necessitates entropy management for continuous exploration
toward scaling compute for RL. To this end, we investigate entropy dynamics
both theoretically and empirically. Our derivation highlights that, the change
in policy entropy is driven by the covariance between action probability and
the change in logits, which is proportional to its advantage when using Policy
Gradient-like algorithms. Empirical study shows that, the values of covariance
term and entropy differences matched exactly, supporting the theoretical
conclusion. Moreover, the covariance term stays mostly positive throughout
training, further explaining why policy entropy would decrease monotonically.
Through understanding the mechanism behind entropy dynamics, we motivate to
control entropy by restricting the update of high-covariance tokens.
Specifically, we propose two simple yet effective techniques, namely Clip-Cov
and KL-Cov, which clip and apply KL penalty to tokens with high covariances
respectively. Experiments show that these methods encourage exploration, thus
helping policy escape entropy collapse and achieve better downstream
performance.
   id: 2505.22617
   ai_summary: Entropy dynamics in reinforcement learning with large language models are investigated to prevent policy entropy collapse and improve exploration.

   title: Chain-of-Model Learning for Language Model
   summary: In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm, termed Chain-of-Model
(CoM), which incorporates the causal relationship into the hidden states of
each layer as a chain style, thereby introducing great scaling efficiency in
model training and inference flexibility in deployment. We introduce the
concept of Chain-of-Representation (CoR), which formulates the hidden states at
each layer as a combination of multiple sub-representations (i.e., chains) at
the hidden dimension level. In each layer, each chain from the output
representations can only view all of its preceding chains in the input
representations. Consequently, the model built upon CoM framework can
progressively scale up the model size by increasing the chains based on the
previous models (i.e., chains), and offer multiple sub-models at varying sizes
for elastic inference by using different chain numbers. Based on this
principle, we devise Chain-of-Language-Model (CoLM), which incorporates the
idea of CoM into each layer of Transformer architecture. Based on CoLM, we
further introduce CoLM-Air by introducing a KV sharing mechanism, that computes
all keys and values within the first chain and then shares across all chains.
This design demonstrates additional extensibility, such as enabling seamless LM
switching, prefilling acceleration and so on. Experimental results demonstrate
our CoLM family can achieve comparable performance to the standard Transformer,
while simultaneously enabling greater flexiblity, such as progressive scaling
to improve training efficiency and offer multiple varying model sizes for
elastic inference, paving a a new way toward building language models. Our code
will be released in the future at: https://github.com/microsoft/CoLM.

   title: Beyond 'Aha!': Toward Systematic Meta-Abilities Alignment in Large
  Reasoning Models
   summary: Large reasoning models (LRMs) already possess a latent capacity for long
chain-of-thought reasoning. Prior work has shown that outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) can incidentally elicit advanced reasoning
behaviors such as self-correction, backtracking, and verification phenomena
often referred to as the model's "aha moment". However, the timing and
consistency of these emergent behaviors remain unpredictable and
uncontrollable, limiting the scalability and reliability of LRMs' reasoning
capabilities. To address these limitations, we move beyond reliance on prompts
and coincidental "aha moments". Instead, we explicitly align models with three
meta-abilities: deduction, induction, and abduction, using automatically
generated, self-verifiable tasks. Our three stage-pipeline individual
alignment, parameter-space merging, and domain-specific reinforcement learning,
boosting performance by over 10\% relative to instruction-tuned baselines.
Furthermore, domain-specific RL from the aligned checkpoint yields an
additional 2\% average gain in the performance ceiling across math, coding, and
science benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit meta-ability alignment offers a
scalable and dependable foundation for reasoning. Code is available at:

   title: TabSTAR: A Foundation Tabular Model With Semantically Target-Aware
  Representations
   summary: While deep learning has achieved remarkable success across many domains, it
has historically underperformed on tabular learning tasks, which remain
dominated by gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs). However, recent
advancements are paving the way for Tabular Foundation Models, which can
leverage real-world knowledge and generalize across diverse datasets,
particularly when the data contains free-text. Although incorporating language
model capabilities into tabular tasks has been explored, most existing methods
utilize static, target-agnostic textual representations, limiting their
effectiveness. We introduce TabSTAR: a Foundation Tabular Model with
Semantically Target-Aware Representations. TabSTAR is designed to enable
transfer learning on tabular data with textual features, with an architecture
free of dataset-specific parameters. It unfreezes a pretrained text encoder and
takes as input target tokens, which provide the model with the context needed
to learn task-specific embeddings. TabSTAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance for both medium- and large-sized datasets across known benchmarks
of classification tasks with text features, and its pretraining phase exhibits
scaling laws in the number of datasets, offering a pathway for further
performance improvements.

   summary: Academic poster generation is a crucial yet challenging task in scientific
communication, requiring the compression of long-context interleaved documents
into a single, visually coherent page. To address this challenge, we introduce
the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent
conference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on
(i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual
Coherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic
and informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably
(iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by
VLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose
PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser
distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns
text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and
spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by
executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and
ensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o
outputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and
poor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary
aesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual
semantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the
Qwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across
nearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens. It transforms a 22-page paper
into a finalized yet editable .pptx poster - all for just $0.005. These
findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated
poster-generation models. The code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/Paper2Poster/Paper2Poster.

   title: Web-Shepherd: Advancing PRMs for Reinforcing Web Agents
   summary: Web navigation is a unique domain that can automate many repetitive real-life
tasks and is challenging as it requires long-horizon sequential decision making
beyond typical multimodal large language model (MLLM) tasks. Yet, specialized
reward models for web navigation that can be utilized during both training and
test-time have been absent until now. Despite the importance of speed and
cost-effectiveness, prior works have utilized MLLMs as reward models, which
poses significant constraints for real-world deployment. To address this, in
this work, we propose the first process reward model (PRM) called Web-Shepherd
which could assess web navigation trajectories in a step-level. To achieve
this, we first construct the WebPRM Collection, a large-scale dataset with 40K
step-level preference pairs and annotated checklists spanning diverse domains
and difficulty levels. Next, we also introduce the WebRewardBench, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for evaluating PRMs. In our experiments, we observe
that our Web-Shepherd achieves about 30 points better accuracy compared to
using GPT-4o on WebRewardBench. Furthermore, when testing on WebArena-lite by
using GPT-4o-mini as the policy and Web-Shepherd as the verifier, we achieve
10.9 points better performance, in 10 less cost compared to using GPT-4o-mini
as the verifier. Our model, dataset, and code are publicly available at LINK.

   title: BLIP3-o: A Family of Fully Open Unified Multimodal Models-Architecture,
  Training and Dataset
   summary: Unifying image understanding and generation has gained growing attention in
recent research on multimodal models. Although design choices for image
understanding have been extensively studied, the optimal model architecture and
training recipe for a unified framework with image generation remain
underexplored. Motivated by the strong potential of autoregressive and
diffusion models for high-quality generation and scalability, we conduct a
comprehensive study of their use in unified multimodal settings, with emphasis
on image representations, modeling objectives, and training strategies.
Grounded in these investigations, we introduce a novel approach that employs a
diffusion transformer to generate semantically rich CLIP image features, in
contrast to conventional VAE-based representations. This design yields both
higher training efficiency and improved generative quality. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that a sequential pretraining strategy for unified models-first
training on image understanding and subsequently on image generation-offers
practical advantages by preserving image understanding capability while
developing strong image generation ability. Finally, we carefully curate a
high-quality instruction-tuning dataset BLIP3o-60k for image generation by
prompting GPT-4o with a diverse set of captions covering various scenes,
objects, human gestures, and more. Building on our innovative model design,
training recipe, and datasets, we develop BLIP3-o, a suite of state-of-the-art
unified multimodal models. BLIP3-o achieves superior performance across most of
the popular benchmarks spanning both image understanding and generation tasks.
To facilitate future research, we fully open-source our models, including code,
model weights, training scripts, and pretraining and instruction tuning
datasets.

   title: MMaDA: Multimodal Large Diffusion Language Models
   summary: We introduce MMaDA, a novel class of multimodal diffusion foundation models
designed to achieve superior performance across diverse domains such as textual
reasoning, multimodal understanding, and text-to-image generation. The approach
is distinguished by three key innovations: (i) MMaDA adopts a unified diffusion
architecture with a shared probabilistic formulation and a modality-agnostic
design, eliminating the need for modality-specific components. This
architecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data
types. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning
strategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities. By aligning
reasoning processes between textual and visual domains, this strategy
facilitates cold-start training for the final reinforcement learning (RL)
stage, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex tasks from the
outset. (iii) We propose UniGRPO, a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm
specifically tailored for diffusion foundation models. Utilizing diversified
reward modeling, UniGRPO unifies post-training across both reasoning and
generation tasks, ensuring consistent performance improvements. Experimental
results demonstrate that MMaDA-8B exhibits strong generalization capabilities
as a unified multimodal foundation model. It surpasses powerful models like
LLaMA-3-7B and Qwen2-7B in textual reasoning, outperforms Show-o and SEED-X in
multimodal understanding, and excels over SDXL and Janus in text-to-image
generation. These achievements highlight MMaDA's effectiveness in bridging the
gap between pretraining and post-training within unified diffusion
architectures, providing a comprehensive framework for future research and
development. We open-source our code and trained models at:
https://github.com/Gen-Verse/MMaDA

   ai_summary: MMaDA, a multimodal diffusion foundation model, achieves superior performance through a unified architecture, mixed long chain-of-thought fine-tuning, and a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm.

   title: Table-R1: Inference-Time Scaling for Table Reasoning
   summary: In this work, we present the first study to explore inference-time scaling on
table reasoning tasks. We develop and evaluate two post-training strategies to
enable inference-time scaling: distillation from frontier model reasoning
traces and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). For
distillation, we introduce a large-scale dataset of reasoning traces generated
by DeepSeek-R1, which we use to fine-tune LLMs into the Table-R1-SFT model. For
RLVR, we propose task-specific verifiable reward functions and apply the GRPO
algorithm to obtain the Table-R1-Zero model. We evaluate our Table-R1-series
models across diverse table reasoning tasks, including short-form QA, fact
verification, and free-form QA. Notably, the Table-R1-Zero model matches or
exceeds the performance of GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1, while using only a
7B-parameter LLM. It also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain
datasets. Extensive ablation and qualitative analyses reveal the benefits of
instruction tuning, model architecture choices, and cross-task generalization,
as well as emergence of essential table reasoning skills during RL training.
   id: 2505.23621
   ai_summary: Two post-training strategies, distillation and RLVR, enable inference-time scaling in table reasoning tasks, resulting in a model (Table-R1-Zero) that matches GPT-4.1's performance using fewer parameters and shows strong generalization.

   title: SWE-rebench: An Automated Pipeline for Task Collection and
  Decontaminated Evaluation of Software Engineering Agents
   summary: LLM-based agents have shown promising capabilities in a growing range of
software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, advancing this field faces two
critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially
data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with
development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes
of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code
generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive
tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive
SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks
quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these
limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to
continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub
repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset
comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for
reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous
supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a
contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare
results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and
show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to
contamination issues.

   title: Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reward Model through Reinforcement
  Fine-Tuning
   summary: Recent advances in multimodal Reward Models (RMs) have shown significant
promise in delivering reward signals to align vision models with human
preferences. However, current RMs are generally restricted to providing direct
responses or engaging in shallow reasoning processes with limited depth, often
leading to inaccurate reward signals. We posit that incorporating explicit long
chains of thought (CoT) into the reward reasoning process can significantly
strengthen their reliability and robustness. Furthermore, we believe that once
RMs internalize CoT reasoning, their direct response accuracy can also be
improved through implicit reasoning capabilities. To this end, this paper
proposes UnifiedReward-Think, the first unified multimodal CoT-based reward
model, capable of multi-dimensional, step-by-step long-chain reasoning for both
visual understanding and generation reward tasks. Specifically, we adopt an
exploration-driven reinforcement fine-tuning approach to elicit and incentivize
the model's latent complex reasoning ability: (1) We first use a small amount
of image generation preference data to distill the reasoning process of GPT-4o,
which is then used for the model's cold start to learn the format and structure
of CoT reasoning. (2) Subsequently, by leveraging the model's prior knowledge
and generalization capabilities, we prepare large-scale unified multimodal
preference data to elicit the model's reasoning process across various vision
tasks. During this phase, correct reasoning outputs are retained for rejection
sampling to refine the model (3) while incorrect predicted samples are finally
used for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement
fine-tuning, enabling the model to explore diverse reasoning paths and optimize
for correct and robust solutions. Extensive experiments across various vision
reward tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model.

   title: Grokking in the Wild: Data Augmentation for Real-World Multi-Hop
  Reasoning with Transformers
   summary: Transformers have achieved great success in numerous NLP tasks but continue
to exhibit notable gaps in multi-step factual reasoning, especially when
real-world knowledge is sparse. Recent advances in grokking have demonstrated
that neural networks can transition from memorizing to perfectly generalizing
once they detect underlying logical patterns - yet these studies have primarily
used small, synthetic tasks. In this paper, for the first time, we extend
grokking to real-world factual data and address the challenge of dataset
sparsity by augmenting existing knowledge graphs with carefully designed
synthetic data to raise the ratio phi_r of inferred facts to atomic facts
above the threshold required for grokking. Surprisingly, we find that even
factually incorrect synthetic data can strengthen emergent reasoning circuits
rather than degrade accuracy, as it forces the model to rely on relational
structure rather than memorization. When evaluated on multi-hop reasoning
benchmarks, our approach achieves up to 95-100% accuracy on 2WikiMultiHopQA -
substantially improving over strong baselines and matching or exceeding current
state-of-the-art results. We further provide an in-depth analysis of how
increasing phi_r drives the formation of generalizing circuits inside
Transformers. Our findings suggest that grokking-based data augmentation can
unlock implicit multi-hop reasoning capabilities, opening the door to more
robust and interpretable factual reasoning in large-scale language models.

   ai_summary: Grokking with synthetic data augmentation in knowledge graphs enhances Transformer models' multi-step factual reasoning on real-world tasks, achieving high accuracy on benchmarks.

   title: QwenLong-L1: Towards Long-Context Large Reasoning Models with
  Reinforcement Learning
   summary: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning
capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). These improvements have
primarily been observed within the short-context reasoning tasks. In contrast,
extending LRMs to effectively process and reason on long-context inputs via RL
remains a critical unsolved challenge. To bridge this gap, we first formalize
the paradigm of long-context reasoning RL, and identify key challenges in
suboptimal training efficiency and unstable optimization process. To address
these issues, we propose QwenLong-L1, a framework that adapts short-context
LRMs to long-context scenarios via progressive context scaling. Specifically,
we utilize a warm-up supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to establish a robust
initial policy, followed by a curriculum-guided phased RL technique to
stabilize the policy evolution, and enhanced with a difficulty-aware
retrospective sampling strategy to incentivize the policy exploration.
Experiments on seven long-context document question-answering benchmarks
demonstrate that QwenLong-L1-32B outperforms flagship LRMs like OpenAI-o3-mini
and Qwen3-235B-A22B, achieving performance on par with
Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, demonstrating leading performance among
state-of-the-art LRMs. This work advances the development of practical
long-context LRMs capable of robust reasoning across information-intensive
environments.

   title: Flow-GRPO: Training Flow Matching Models via Online RL
   summary: We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement
learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies:
(1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation
(SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps,
enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction
strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original
inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without
performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple
text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly
perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting
GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy
improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation.
Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment.
Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase
at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our
experiments.

   ai_summary: Flow-GRPO combines online reinforcement learning with flow matching models through an ODE-to-SDE conversion and denoising reduction, improving sampling efficiency and performance across text-to-image tasks.

   title: Voila: Voice-Language Foundation Models for Real-Time Autonomous
  Interaction and Voice Role-Play
   summary: A voice AI agent that blends seamlessly into daily life would interact with
humans in an autonomous, real-time, and emotionally expressive manner. Rather
than merely reacting to commands, it would continuously listen, reason, and
respond proactively, fostering fluid, dynamic, and emotionally resonant
interactions. We introduce Voila, a family of large voice-language foundation
models that make a step towards this vision. Voila moves beyond traditional
pipeline systems by adopting a new end-to-end architecture that enables
full-duplex, low-latency conversations while preserving rich vocal nuances such
as tone, rhythm, and emotion. It achieves a response latency of just 195
milliseconds, surpassing the average human response time. Its hierarchical
multi-scale Transformer integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) with powerful acoustic modeling, enabling natural, persona-aware
voice generation -- where users can simply write text instructions to define
the speaker's identity, tone, and other characteristics. Moreover, Voila
supports over one million pre-built voices and efficient customization of new
ones from brief audio samples as short as 10 seconds. Beyond spoken dialogue,
Voila is designed as a unified model for a wide range of voice-based
applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech
(TTS), and, with minimal adaptation, multilingual speech translation. Voila is
fully open-sourced to support open research and accelerate progress toward
next-generation human-machine interactions.

   title: Alchemist: Turning Public Text-to-Image Data into Generative Gold
   summary: Pre-training equips text-to-image (T2I) models with broad world knowledge,
but this alone is often insufficient to achieve high aesthetic quality and
alignment. Consequently, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is crucial for further
refinement. However, its effectiveness highly depends on the quality of the
fine-tuning dataset. Existing public SFT datasets frequently target narrow
domains (e.g., anime or specific art styles), and the creation of high-quality,
general-purpose SFT datasets remains a significant challenge. Current curation
methods are often costly and struggle to identify truly impactful samples. This
challenge is further complicated by the scarcity of public general-purpose
datasets, as leading models often rely on large, proprietary, and poorly
documented internal data, hindering broader research progress. This paper
introduces a novel methodology for creating general-purpose SFT datasets by
leveraging a pre-trained generative model as an estimator of high-impact
training samples. We apply this methodology to construct and release Alchemist,
a compact (3,350 samples) yet highly effective SFT dataset. Experiments
demonstrate that Alchemist substantially improves the generative quality of
five public T2I models while preserving diversity and style. Additionally, we
release the fine-tuned models' weights to the public.

   title: MME-Reasoning: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Logical Reasoning in MLLMs
   summary: Logical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence and an
essential capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite the
significant advancement in multimodal reasoning, existing benchmarks fail to
comprehensively evaluate their reasoning abilities due to the lack of explicit
categorization for logical reasoning types and an unclear understanding of
reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce MME-Reasoning, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of MLLMs, which covers all
three types of reasoning (i.e., inductive, deductive, and abductive) in its
questions. We carefully curate the data to ensure that each question
effectively evaluates reasoning ability rather than perceptual skills or
knowledge breadth, and extend the evaluation protocols to cover the evaluation
of diverse questions. Our evaluation reveals substantial limitations of
state-of-the-art MLLMs when subjected to holistic assessments of logical
reasoning capabilities. Even the most advanced MLLMs show limited performance
in comprehensive logical reasoning, with notable performance imbalances across
reasoning types. In addition, we conducted an in-depth analysis of approaches
such as ``thinking mode'' and Rule-based RL, which are commonly believed to
enhance reasoning abilities. These findings highlight the critical limitations
and performance imbalances of current MLLMs in diverse logical reasoning
scenarios, providing comprehensive and systematic insights into the
understanding and evaluation of reasoning capabilities.

   title: AdaptThink: Reasoning Models Can Learn When to Think
   summary: Recently, large reasoning models have achieved impressive performance on
various tasks by employing human-like deep thinking. However, the lengthy
thinking process substantially increases inference overhead, making efficiency
a critical bottleneck. In this work, we first demonstrate that NoThinking,
which prompts the reasoning model to skip thinking and directly generate the
final solution, is a better choice for relatively simple tasks in terms of both
performance and efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose AdaptThink, a novel
RL algorithm to teach reasoning models to choose the optimal thinking mode
adaptively based on problem difficulty. Specifically, AdaptThink features two
core components: (1) a constrained optimization objective that encourages the
model to choose NoThinking while maintaining the overall performance; (2) an
importance sampling strategy that balances Thinking and NoThinking samples
during on-policy training, thereby enabling cold start and allowing the model
to explore and exploit both thinking modes throughout the training process. Our
experiments indicate that AdaptThink significantly reduces the inference costs
while further enhancing performance. Notably, on three math datasets,
AdaptThink reduces the average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B
by 53% and improves its accuracy by 2.4%, highlighting the promise of adaptive
thinking-mode selection for optimizing the balance between reasoning quality
and efficiency. Our codes and models are available at
https://github.com/THU-KEG/AdaptThink.

   title: Parallel Scaling Law for Language Models
   summary: It is commonly believed that scaling language models should commit a
significant space or time cost, by increasing the parameters (parameter
scaling) or output tokens (inference-time scaling). We introduce the third and
more inference-efficient scaling paradigm: increasing the model's parallel
computation during both training and inference time. We apply P diverse and
learnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in
parallel, and dynamically aggregate the P outputs. This method, namely
parallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing
parameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure,
data, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it
through large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with P parallel
streams is similar to scaling the parameters by O(log P) while showing
superior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22times
less memory increase and 6times less latency increase compared to parameter
scaling that achieves the same performance improvement. It can also recycle an
off-the-shelf pre-trained model into a parallelly scaled one by post-training
on a small amount of tokens, further reducing the training budget. The new
scaling law we discovered potentially facilitates the deployment of more
powerful models in low-resource scenarios, and provides an alternative
perspective for the role of computation in machine learning.

   title: MiMo: Unlocking the Reasoning Potential of Language Model -- From
  Pretraining to Posttraining
   summary: We present MiMo-7B, a large language model born for reasoning tasks, with
optimization across both pre-training and post-training stages. During
pre-training, we enhance the data preprocessing pipeline and employ a
three-stage data mixing strategy to strengthen the base model's reasoning
potential. MiMo-7B-Base is pre-trained on 25 trillion tokens, with additional
Multi-Token Prediction objective for enhanced performance and accelerated
inference speed. During post-training, we curate a dataset of 130K verifiable
mathematics and programming problems for reinforcement learning, integrating a
test-difficulty-driven code-reward scheme to alleviate sparse-reward issues and
employing strategic data resampling to stabilize training. Extensive
evaluations show that MiMo-7B-Base possesses exceptional reasoning potential,
outperforming even much larger 32B models. The final RL-tuned model,
MiMo-7B-RL, achieves superior performance on mathematics, code and general
reasoning tasks, surpassing the performance of OpenAI o1-mini. The model
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/xiaomimimo/MiMo.

   title: On Path to Multimodal Generalist: General-Level and General-Bench
   summary: The Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) is currently experiencing rapid
growth, driven by the advanced capabilities of LLMs. Unlike earlier
specialists, existing MLLMs are evolving towards a Multimodal Generalist
paradigm. Initially limited to understanding multiple modalities, these models
have advanced to not only comprehend but also generate across modalities. Their
capabilities have expanded from coarse-grained to fine-grained multimodal
understanding and from supporting limited modalities to arbitrary ones. While
many benchmarks exist to assess MLLMs, a critical question arises: Can we
simply assume that higher performance across tasks indicates a stronger MLLM
capability, bringing us closer to human-level AI? We argue that the answer is
not as straightforward as it seems. This project introduces General-Level, an
evaluation framework that defines 5-scale levels of MLLM performance and
generality, offering a methodology to compare MLLMs and gauge the progress of
existing systems towards more robust multimodal generalists and, ultimately,
towards AGI. At the core of the framework is the concept of Synergy, which
measures whether models maintain consistent capabilities across comprehension
and generation, and across multiple modalities. To support this evaluation, we
present General-Bench, which encompasses a broader spectrum of skills,
modalities, formats, and capabilities, including over 700 tasks and 325,800
instances. The evaluation results that involve over 100 existing
state-of-the-art MLLMs uncover the capability rankings of generalists,
highlighting the challenges in reaching genuine AI. We expect this project to
pave the way for future research on next-generation multimodal foundation
models, providing a robust infrastructure to accelerate the realization of AGI.

   title: Distilling LLM Agent into Small Models with Retrieval and Code Tools
   summary: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain
computationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into
smaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher
LLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual
knowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited
capability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for
transferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from
LLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent
distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method
called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated
trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for
improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight
reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both
in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small
as 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier
larger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the
potential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small
agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/Nardien/agent-distillation.

   title: Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models: Advances,
  Challenges, and Opportunities
   summary: Recent years have seen remarkable progress in both multimodal understanding
models and image generation models. Despite their respective successes, these
two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural
paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal
understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image
generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified
frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new
capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for
unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains
pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts
toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future
research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements
in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we
review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural
paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that
fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the
structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally,
we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering
resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing
this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and
data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid
advancements and will regularly update this survey. Our goal is to inspire
further research and provide a valuable reference for the community. The
references associated with this survey are available on GitHub

   title: RM-R1: Reward Modeling as Reasoning
   summary: Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences, especially through reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should
stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a
score or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores
or directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle
to integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability.
Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on
reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating
reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's
interpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of
generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which
formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented
training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists
of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by
self-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating
candidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve
state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across
multiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger
open-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by
up to 13.8%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis
to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate
future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at
https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.

   title: Quartet: Native FP4 Training Can Be Optimal for Large Language Models
   summary: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has been paralleled by
unprecedented increases in computational demands, with training costs for
state-of-the-art models doubling every few months. Training models directly in
low-precision arithmetic offers a solution, by improving both computational
throughput and energy efficiency. Specifically, NVIDIA's recent Blackwell
architecture facilitates extremely low-precision operations, specifically FP4
variants, promising substantial efficiency gains. Yet, current algorithms for
training LLMs in FP4 precision face significant accuracy degradation and often
rely on mixed-precision fallbacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate
hardware-supported FP4 training and introduce Quartet, a new approach enabling
accurate, end-to-end FP4 training with all the major computations (in e.g.
linear layers) being performed in low precision. Through extensive evaluations
on Llama-type models, we reveal a new low-precision scaling law that quantifies
performance trade-offs across varying bit-widths and allows us to identify a
"near-optimal" low-precision training technique in terms of
accuracy-vs-computation, called Quartet. We implement Quartet using optimized
CUDA kernels tailored for NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, and show that it can achieve
state-of-the-art accuracy for FP4 precision, successfully training
billion-scale models. Our method demonstrates that fully FP4-based training is
a competitive alternative to standard-precision and FP8 training. Our code is
available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/Quartet.

   title: Scaling Law for Quantization-Aware Training
   summary: Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory
resources, creating deployment challenges. Quantization-aware training (QAT)
addresses these challenges by reducing model precision while maintaining
performance. However, the scaling behavior of QAT, especially at 4-bit
precision (W4A4), is not well understood. Existing QAT scaling laws often
ignore key factors such as the number of training tokens and quantization
granularity, which limits their applicability. This paper proposes a unified
scaling law for QAT that models quantization error as a function of model size,
training data volume, and quantization group size. Through 268 QAT experiments,
we show that quantization error decreases as model size increases, but rises
with more training tokens and coarser quantization granularity. To identify the
sources of W4A4 quantization error, we decompose it into weight and activation
components. Both components follow the overall trend of W4A4 quantization
error, but with different sensitivities. Specifically, weight quantization
error increases more rapidly with more training tokens. Further analysis shows
that the activation quantization error in the FC2 layer, caused by outliers, is
the primary bottleneck of W4A4 QAT quantization error. By applying
mixed-precision quantization to address this bottleneck, we demonstrate that
weight and activation quantization errors can converge to similar levels.
Additionally, with more training data, weight quantization error eventually
exceeds activation quantization error, suggesting that reducing weight
quantization error is also important in such scenarios. These findings offer
key insights for improving QAT research and development.

   title: SageAttention3: Microscaling FP4 Attention for Inference and An
  Exploration of 8-Bit Training
   summary: The efficiency of attention is important due to its quadratic time
complexity. We enhance the efficiency of attention through two key
contributions: First, we leverage the new FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell GPUs to
accelerate attention computation. Our implementation achieves 1038 TOPS on
RTX5090, which is a 5x speedup over the fastest FlashAttention on RTX5090.
Experiments show that our FP4 attention can accelerate inference of various
models in a plug-and-play way. Second, we pioneer low-bit attention to training
tasks. Existing low-bit attention works like FlashAttention3 and SageAttention
focus only on inference. However, the efficiency of training large models is
also important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied
to training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both
forward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention
achieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower
convergence in pretraining tasks. The code will be available at
https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.

   title: Insights into DeepSeek-V3: Scaling Challenges and Reflections on
  Hardware for AI Architectures
   summary: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has unveiled critical
limitations in current hardware architectures, including constraints in memory
capacity, computational efficiency, and interconnection bandwidth. DeepSeek-V3,
trained on 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs, demonstrates how hardware-aware model
co-design can effectively address these challenges, enabling cost-efficient
training and inference at scale. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of
the DeepSeek-V3/R1 model architecture and its AI infrastructure, highlighting
key innovations such as Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) for enhanced memory
efficiency, Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures for optimized
computation-communication trade-offs, FP8 mixed-precision training to unlock
the full potential of hardware capabilities, and a Multi-Plane Network Topology
to minimize cluster-level network overhead. Building on the hardware
bottlenecks encountered during DeepSeek-V3's development, we engage in a
broader discussion with academic and industry peers on potential future
hardware directions, including precise low-precision computation units,
scale-up and scale-out convergence, and innovations in low-latency
communication fabrics. These insights underscore the critical role of hardware
and model co-design in meeting the escalating demands of AI workloads, offering
a practical blueprint for innovation in next-generation AI systems.

   title: R2R: Efficiently Navigating Divergent Reasoning Paths with Small-Large
  Model Token Routing
   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities at the
cost of substantial inference overhead, posing substantial deployment
challenges. Although distilled Small Language Models (SLMs) significantly
enhance efficiency, their performance suffers as they fail to follow LLMs'
reasoning paths. Luckily, we reveal that only a small fraction of tokens
genuinely diverge reasoning paths between LLMs and SLMs. Most generated tokens
are either identical or exhibit neutral differences, such as minor variations
in abbreviations or expressions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce **Roads
to Rome (R2R)**, a neural token routing method that selectively utilizes LLMs
only for these critical, path-divergent tokens, while leaving the majority of
token generation to the SLM. We also develop an automatic data generation
pipeline that identifies divergent tokens and generates token-level routing
labels to train the lightweight router. We apply R2R to combine R1-1.5B and
R1-32B models from the DeepSeek family, and evaluate on challenging math,
coding, and QA benchmarks. With an average activated parameter size of 5.6B,
R2R surpasses the average accuracy of R1-7B by 1.6x, outperforming even the
R1-14B model. Compared to R1-32B, it delivers a 2.8x wall-clock speedup with
comparable performance, advancing the Pareto frontier of test-time scaling
efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/R2R.

   title: System Prompt Optimization with Meta-Learning
   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, with
optimizing their input prompts playing a pivotal role in maximizing their
performance. However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic
system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt
optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or
tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized,
applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce
the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to
design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable
to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning
framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various
user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user
prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct
experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we
show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to
diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system
prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer
optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved
performance.

   title: Spatial-MLLM: Boosting MLLM Capabilities in Visual-based Spatial
  Intelligence
   summary: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their
spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on
additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their
utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this
paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial
reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which
rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our
key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward
visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder
architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and
a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to
extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into
unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we
propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects
the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under
limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial
reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k
dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO.
Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our
spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of
visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. Project page:

   title: SynLogic: Synthesizing Verifiable Reasoning Data at Scale for Learning
  Logical Reasoning and Beyond
   summary: Recent advances such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated the
potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities in
Large Language Models (LLMs). While open-source replication efforts have
primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for
developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is
partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data
suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for
developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental
building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data
synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data
at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic
approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and
quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making
them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we
validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B
and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning
performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and
coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and
significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training
model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These
findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader
reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline
and the SynLogic dataset at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/SynLogic.

   title: ZeroSearch: Incentivize the Search Capability of LLMs without Searching
   summary: Effective information searching is essential for enhancing the reasoning and
generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent research has
explored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities
by interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these
approaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1)
Uncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search
engines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the
training process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires
frequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search
requests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain
scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a
reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the search capabilities of
LLMs without interacting with real search engines. Our approach begins with
lightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module
capable of generating both relevant and noisy documents in response to a query.
During RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that
incrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively
eliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly
challenging retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ZeroSearch effectively incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs using a 3B
LLM as the retrieval module. Remarkably, a 7B retrieval module achieves
comparable performance to the real search engine, while a 14B retrieval module
even surpasses it. Furthermore, it generalizes well across both base and
instruction-tuned models of various parameter sizes and is compatible with a
wide range of RL algorithms.

   title: BizFinBench: A Business-Driven Real-World Financial Benchmark for
  Evaluating LLMs
   summary: Large language models excel in general tasks, yet assessing their reliability
in logic-heavy, precision-critical domains like finance, law, and healthcare
remains challenging. To address this, we introduce BizFinBench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world financial
applications. BizFinBench consists of 6,781 well-annotated queries in Chinese,
spanning five dimensions: numerical calculation, reasoning, information
extraction, prediction recognition, and knowledge-based question answering,
grouped into nine fine-grained categories. The benchmark includes both
objective and subjective metrics. We also introduce IteraJudge, a novel LLM
evaluation method that reduces bias when LLMs serve as evaluators in objective
metrics. We benchmark 25 models, including both proprietary and open-source
systems. Extensive experiments show that no model dominates across all tasks.
Our evaluation reveals distinct capability patterns: (1) In Numerical
Calculation, Claude-3.5-Sonnet (63.18) and DeepSeek-R1 (64.04) lead, while
smaller models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B (15.92) lag significantly; (2) In Reasoning,
proprietary models dominate (ChatGPT-o3: 83.58, Gemini-2.0-Flash: 81.15), with
open-source models trailing by up to 19.49 points; (3) In Information
Extraction, the performance spread is the largest, with DeepSeek-R1 scoring
71.46, while Qwen3-1.7B scores 11.23; (4) In Prediction Recognition,
performance variance is minimal, with top models scoring between 39.16 and
50.00. We find that while current LLMs handle routine finance queries
competently, they struggle with complex scenarios requiring cross-concept
reasoning. BizFinBench offers a rigorous, business-aligned benchmark for future
research. The code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/HiThink-Research/BizFinBench.

   title: Reasoning Model is Stubborn: Diagnosing Instruction Overriding in
  Reasoning Models
   summary: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in long and
complex reasoning tasks. However, they frequently exhibit a problematic
reliance on familiar reasoning patterns, a phenomenon we term reasoning
rigidity. Despite explicit instructions from users, these models often
override clearly stated conditions and default to habitual reasoning
trajectories, leading to incorrect conclusions. This behavior presents
significant challenges, particularly in domains such as mathematics and logic
puzzle, where precise adherence to specified constraints is critical. To
systematically investigate reasoning rigidity, a behavior largely unexplored in
prior work, we introduce a expert-curated diagnostic set, . Our
dataset includes specially modified variants of existing mathematical
benchmarks, namely AIME and MATH500, as well as well-known puzzles deliberately
redesigned to require deviation from familiar reasoning strategies. Using this
dataset, we identify recurring contamination patterns that occur when models
default to ingrained reasoning. Specifically, we categorize this contamination
into three distinctive modes: (i) Interpretation Overload, (ii) Input Distrust,
and (iii) Partial Instruction Attention, each causing models to ignore or
distort provided instructions. We publicly release our diagnostic set to
facilitate future research on mitigating reasoning rigidity in language models.

   title: OmniConsistency: Learning Style-Agnostic Consistency from Paired
  Stylization Data
   summary: Diffusion models have advanced image stylization significantly, yet two core
challenges persist: (1) maintaining consistent stylization in complex scenes,
particularly identity, composition, and fine details, and (2) preventing style
degradation in image-to-image pipelines with style LoRAs. GPT-4o's exceptional
stylization consistency highlights the performance gap between open-source
methods and proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we propose
OmniConsistency, a universal consistency plugin leveraging large-scale
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). OmniConsistency contributes: (1) an in-context
consistency learning framework trained on aligned image pairs for robust
generalization; (2) a two-stage progressive learning strategy decoupling style
learning from consistency preservation to mitigate style degradation; and (3) a
fully plug-and-play design compatible with arbitrary style LoRAs under the Flux
framework. Extensive experiments show that OmniConsistency significantly
enhances visual coherence and aesthetic quality, achieving performance
comparable to commercial state-of-the-art model GPT-4o.

   title: Scaling Reasoning, Losing Control: Evaluating Instruction Following in
  Large Reasoning Models
   summary: Instruction-following is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with user intent. While recent reasoning-oriented models exhibit impressive
performance on complex mathematical problems, their ability to adhere to
natural language instructions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
MathIF, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating instruction-following in
mathematical reasoning tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals a consistent
tension between scaling up reasoning capacity and maintaining controllability,
as models that reason more effectively often struggle to comply with user
directives. We find that models tuned on distilled long chains-of-thought or
trained with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning often degrade in
instruction adherence, especially when generation length increases.
Furthermore, we show that even simple interventions can partially recover
obedience, though at the cost of reasoning performance. These findings
highlight a fundamental tension in current LLM training paradigms and motivate
the need for more instruction-aware reasoning models. We release the code and
data at https://github.com/TingchenFu/MathIF.

   title: Exploring the Latent Capacity of LLMs for One-Step Text Generation
   summary: A recent study showed that large language models (LLMs) can reconstruct
surprisingly long texts - up to thousands of tokens - via autoregressive
generation from just one specially trained input embedding. In this work, we
explore whether such reconstruction is possible without autoregression. We show
that frozen LLMs can generate hundreds of accurate tokens in just one forward
pass, when provided with only two learned embeddings. This reveals a surprising
and underexplored capability of LLMs - multi-token generation without iterative
decoding. We investigate the behaviour of these embeddings and provide insight
into the type of information they encode. We also empirically show that
although these representations are not unique for a given text, they form
connected and local regions in embedding space - a property that suggests the
potential of learning a dedicated encoder into that space.

   title: One RL to See Them All: Visual Triple Unified Reinforcement Learning
   summary: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the use of RL beyond
reasoning tasks remains largely unexplored, especially for perceptionintensive
tasks like object detection and grounding. We propose V-Triune, a Visual Triple
Unified Reinforcement Learning system that enables VLMs to jointly learn visual
reasoning and perception tasks within a single training pipeline. V-Triune
comprises triple complementary components: Sample-Level Data Formatting (to
unify diverse task inputs), Verifier-Level Reward Computation (to deliver
custom rewards via specialized verifiers) , and Source-Level Metric Monitoring
(to diagnose problems at the data-source level). We further introduce a novel
Dynamic IoU reward, which provides adaptive, progressive, and definite feedback
for perception tasks handled by V-Triune. Our approach is instantiated within
off-the-shelf RL training framework using open-source 7B and 32B backbone
models. The resulting model, dubbed Orsta (One RL to See Them All),
demonstrates consistent improvements across both reasoning and perception
tasks. This broad capability is significantly shaped by its training on a
diverse dataset, constructed around four representative visual reasoning tasks
(Math, Puzzle, Chart, and Science) and four visual perception tasks (Grounding,
Detection, Counting, and OCR). Subsequently, Orsta achieves substantial gains
on MEGA-Bench Core, with improvements ranging from +2.1 to an impressive +14.1
across its various 7B and 32B model variants, with performance benefits
extending to a wide range of downstream tasks. These results highlight the
effectiveness and scalability of our unified RL approach for VLMs. The V-Triune
system, along with the Orsta models, is publicly available at
https://github.com/MiniMax-AI.

   title: Step1X-3D: Towards High-Fidelity and Controllable Generation of Textured
  3D Assets
   summary: While generative artificial intelligence has advanced significantly across
text, image, audio, and video domains, 3D generation remains comparatively
underdeveloped due to fundamental challenges such as data scarcity, algorithmic
limitations, and ecosystem fragmentation. To this end, we present Step1X-3D, an
open framework addressing these challenges through: (1) a rigorous data
curation pipeline processing >5M assets to create a 2M high-quality dataset
with standardized geometric and textural properties; (2) a two-stage 3D-native
architecture combining a hybrid VAE-DiT geometry generator with an
diffusion-based texture synthesis module; and (3) the full open-source release
of models, training code, and adaptation modules. For geometry generation, the
hybrid VAE-DiT component produces TSDF representations by employing
perceiver-based latent encoding with sharp edge sampling for detail
preservation. The diffusion-based texture synthesis module then ensures
cross-view consistency through geometric conditioning and latent-space
synchronization. Benchmark results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
that exceeds existing open-source methods, while also achieving competitive
quality with proprietary solutions. Notably, the framework uniquely bridges the
2D and 3D generation paradigms by supporting direct transfer of 2D control
techniques~(e.g., LoRA) to 3D synthesis. By simultaneously advancing data
quality, algorithmic fidelity, and reproducibility, Step1X-3D aims to establish
new standards for open research in controllable 3D asset generation.

   title: GuardReasoner-VL: Safeguarding VLMs via Reinforced Reasoning
   summary: To enhance the safety of VLMs, this paper introduces a novel reasoning-based
VLM guard model dubbed GuardReasoner-VL. The core idea is to incentivize the
guard model to deliberatively reason before making moderation decisions via
online RL. First, we construct GuardReasoner-VLTrain, a reasoning corpus with
123K samples and 631K reasoning steps, spanning text, image, and text-image
inputs. Then, based on it, we cold-start our model's reasoning ability via SFT.
In addition, we further enhance reasoning regarding moderation through online
RL. Concretely, to enhance diversity and difficulty of samples, we conduct
rejection sampling followed by data augmentation via the proposed safety-aware
data concatenation. Besides, we use a dynamic clipping parameter to encourage
exploration in early stages and exploitation in later stages. To balance
performance and token efficiency, we design a length-aware safety reward that
integrates accuracy, format, and token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our model. Remarkably, it surpasses the runner-up by 19.27%
F1 score on average. We release data, code, and models (3B/7B) of
GuardReasoner-VL at https://github.com/yueliu1999/GuardReasoner-VL/

   title: Reflect, Retry, Reward: Self-Improving LLMs via Reinforcement Learning
   summary: We explore a method for improving the performance of large language models
through self-reflection and reinforcement learning. By incentivizing the model
to generate better self-reflections when it answers incorrectly, we demonstrate
that a model's ability to solve complex, verifiable tasks can be enhanced even
when generating synthetic data is infeasible and only binary feedback is
available. Our framework operates in two stages: first, upon failing a given
task, the model generates a self-reflective commentary analyzing its previous
attempt; second, the model is given another attempt at the task with the
self-reflection in context. If the subsequent attempt succeeds, the tokens
generated during the self-reflection phase are rewarded. Our experimental
results show substantial performance gains across a variety of model
architectures, as high as 34.7% improvement at math equation writing and 18.1%
improvement at function calling. Notably, smaller fine-tuned models (1.5
billion to 7 billion parameters) outperform models in the same family that are
10 times larger. Our novel paradigm is thus an exciting pathway to more useful
and reliable language models that can self-improve on challenging tasks with
limited external feedback.

   title: MiniMax-M1: Scaling Test-Time Compute Efficiently with Lightning
  Attention
   summary: We introduce MiniMax-M1, the world's first open-weight, large-scale
hybrid-attention reasoning model. MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention
mechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model,
which contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters
activated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1
million tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning
attention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time
compute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that
require processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained
using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including
sandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to
M1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel
RL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling
weights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.
Combining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on
512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just
$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K
thinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate
phase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our
models are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the
original DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex
software engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks. We publicly
release MiniMax-M1 at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M1.

Specifically, we reframe next-token prediction as a reasoning task trained
using RL, where it receives verifiable rewards for correctly predicting the
next token for a given context. RPT offers a scalable method to leverage vast
amounts of text data for general-purpose RL, rather than relying on
domain-specific annotated answers. By incentivizing the capability of
next-token reasoning, RPT significantly improves the language modeling accuracy
of predicting the next tokens. Moreover, RPT provides a strong pre-trained
foundation for further reinforcement fine-tuning. The scaling curves show that
increased training compute consistently improves the next-token prediction
accuracy. The results position RPT as an effective and promising scaling
paradigm to advance language model pre-training.

   title: Beyond the 80/20 Rule: High-Entropy Minority Tokens Drive Effective
  Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning
   summary: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work,
we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of
token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens
influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of
tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer
the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy
patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the
base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy
tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e.,
forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy
gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20
rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable
to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly
surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71
on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models,
highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the
80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These
findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing
the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our
results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy
perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to
further improve LLM reasoning.

   ai_summary: Token entropy patterns are crucial in RLVR, with high-entropy tokens significantly impacting reasoning performance and model optimization.

   title: SmolVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Affordable and Efficient
  Robotics
   summary: Vision-language models (VLMs) pretrained on large-scale multimodal datasets
encode rich visual and linguistic knowledge, making them a strong foundation
for robotics. Rather than training robotic policies from scratch, recent
approaches adapt VLMs into vision-language-action (VLA) models that enable
natural language-driven perception and control. However, existing VLAs are
typically massive--often with billions of parameters--leading to high training
costs and limited real-world deployability. Moreover, they rely on academic and
industrial datasets, overlooking the growing availability of
community-collected data from affordable robotic platforms. In this work, we
present SmolVLA, a small, efficient, and community-driven VLA that drastically
reduces both training and inference costs, while retaining competitive
performance. SmolVLA is designed to be trained on a single GPU and deployed on
consumer-grade GPUs or even CPUs. To further improve responsiveness, we
introduce an asynchronous inference stack decoupling perception and action
prediction from action execution, allowing higher control rates with chunked
action generation. Despite its compact size, SmolVLA achieves performance
comparable to VLAs that are 10x larger. We evaluate SmolVLA on a range of both
simulated as well as real-world robotic benchmarks and release all code,
pretrained models, and training data.
   id: 2506.01844
   ai_summary: SmolVLA is a compact, efficient vision-language-action model that achieves competitive performance at reduced computational costs and can be deployed on consumer-grade hardware.

   title: ProRL: Prolonged Reinforcement Learning Expands Reasoning Boundaries in
  Large Language Models
   summary: Recent advances in reasoning-centric language models have highlighted
reinforcement learning (RL) as a promising method for aligning models with
verifiable rewards. However, it remains contentious whether RL truly expands a
model's reasoning capabilities or merely amplifies high-reward outputs already
latent in the base model's distribution, and whether continually scaling up RL
compute reliably leads to improved reasoning performance. In this work, we
challenge prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that prolonged RL (ProRL)
training can uncover novel reasoning strategies that are inaccessible to base
models, even under extensive sampling. We introduce ProRL, a novel training
methodology that incorporates KL divergence control, reference policy
resetting, and a diverse suite of tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals that
RL-trained models consistently outperform base models across a wide range of
pass@k evaluations, including scenarios where base models fail entirely
regardless of the number of attempts. We further show that reasoning boundary
improvements correlates strongly with task competence of base model and
training duration, suggesting that RL can explore and populate new regions of
solution space over time. These findings offer new insights into the conditions
under which RL meaningfully expands reasoning boundaries in language models and
establish a foundation for future work on long-horizon RL for reasoning. We
release model weights to support further research:

   title: Will It Still Be True Tomorrow? Multilingual Evergreen Question
  Classification to Improve Trustworthy QA
   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate in question answering (QA)
tasks. A key yet underexplored factor contributing to this is the temporality
of questions -- whether they are evergreen (answers remain stable over time) or
mutable (answers change). In this work, we introduce EverGreenQA, the first
multilingual QA dataset with evergreen labels, supporting both evaluation and
training. Using EverGreenQA, we benchmark 12 modern LLMs to assess whether they
encode question temporality explicitly (via verbalized judgments) or implicitly
(via uncertainty signals). We also train EG-E5, a lightweight multilingual
classifier that achieves SoTA performance on this task. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical utility of evergreen classification across three applications:
improving self-knowledge estimation, filtering QA datasets, and explaining
GPT-4o retrieval behavior.

   title: Confidence Is All You Need: Few-Shot RL Fine-Tuning of Language Models
   summary: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning, yet post-training remains
critical for aligning their behavior with task goals. Existing reinforcement
learning (RL) methods often depend on costly human annotations or external
reward models. We propose Reinforcement Learning via Self-Confidence (RLSC),
which uses the model's own confidence as reward signals-eliminating the need
for labels, preference models, or reward engineering. Applied to
Qwen2.5-Math-7B with only 16 samples per question and 10 or 20 training steps,
RLSC improves accuracy by +13.4% on AIME2024, +21.2% on MATH500, +21.7% on
Minerva Math, +20.8% on Olympiadbench, and +9.7% on AMC23. RLSC provides a
simple, scalable post-training method for inference models, requiring only a
small number of samples and unlabelled supervision.

   title: Drag-and-Drop LLMs: Zero-Shot Prompt-to-Weights
   summary: Modern Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) reduce the cost of customizing large language models (LLMs),
yet still require a separate optimization run for every downstream dataset. We
introduce Drag-and-Drop LLMs (\textit{DnD)}, a prompt-conditioned
parameter generator that eliminates per-task training by mapping a handful of
unlabeled task prompts directly to LoRA weight updates. A lightweight text
encoder distills each prompt batch into condition embeddings, which are then
transformed by a cascaded hyper-convolutional decoder into the full set of LoRA
matrices. Once trained in a diverse collection of prompt-checkpoint pairs, DnD
produces task-specific parameters in seconds, yielding i) up to
12,000times lower overhead than full fine-tuning, ii) average gains
up to 30\% in performance over the strongest training LoRAs on unseen
common-sense reasoning, math, coding, and multimodal benchmarks, and iii)
robust cross-domain generalization despite never seeing the target data or
labels. Our results demonstrate that prompt-conditioned parameter generation is
a viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for rapidly specializing
LLMs. Our project is available at
https://jerryliang24.github.io/DnD{https://jerryliang24.github.io/DnD}.

   title: Lingshu: A Generalist Foundation Model for Unified Multimodal Medical
  Understanding and Reasoning
   summary: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their
large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their
effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent
discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the
general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical
limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2)
heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation
processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical
scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data
curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data
not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and
general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual
question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a
multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the
curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu
undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its
task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the
potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm
to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop
MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal
and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model
assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical
tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results
show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal
models on most tasks ...

   title: Seedance 1.0: Exploring the Boundaries of Video Generation Models
   summary: Notable breakthroughs in diffusion modeling have propelled rapid improvements
in video generation, yet current foundational model still face critical
challenges in simultaneously balancing prompt following, motion plausibility,

high-performance and inference-efficient video foundation generation model that
integrates several core technical improvements: (i) multi-source data curation
augmented with precision and meaningful video captioning, enabling
comprehensive learning across diverse scenarios; (ii) an efficient architecture
design with proposed training paradigm, which allows for natively supporting

leveraging fine-grained supervised fine-tuning, and video-specific RLHF with
multi-dimensional reward mechanisms for comprehensive performance improvements;
(iv) excellent model acceleration achieving ~10x inference speedup through
multi-stage distillation strategies and system-level optimizations. Seedance
1.0 can generate a 5-second video at 1080p resolution only with 41.4 seconds
(NVIDIA-L20). Compared to state-of-the-art video generation models, Seedance
1.0 stands out with high-quality and fast video generation having superior
spatiotemporal fluidity with structural stability, precise instruction
adherence in complex multi-subject contexts, native multi-shot narrative
coherence with consistent subject representation.

   title: ReasonMed: A 370K Multi-Agent Generated Dataset for Advancing Medical
  Reasoning
   summary: Though reasoning-based large language models (LLMs) have excelled in
mathematics and programming, their capabilities in knowledge-intensive medical
question answering remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce
ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset, comprising 370k high-quality
examples distilled from 1.7 million initial reasoning paths generated by
various LLMs. ReasonMed is constructed through a multi-agent
verification and refinement process, where we design an Error Refiner
to enhance the reasoning paths by identifying and correcting error-prone steps
flagged by a verifier. Leveraging ReasonMed, we systematically investigate best
practices for training medical reasoning models and find that combining
detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with concise answer summaries yields
the most effective fine-tuning strategy. Based on this strategy, we train
ReasonMed-7B, which sets a new benchmark for sub-10B models, outperforming the
prior best by 4.17\% and even exceeding LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60\%.

   title: AlphaOne: Reasoning Models Thinking Slow and Fast at Test Time
   summary: This paper presents AlphaOne (alpha1), a universal framework for
modulating reasoning progress in large reasoning models (LRMs) at test time.
alpha1 first introduces alpha moment, which represents the scaled
thinking phase with a universal parameter alpha. Within this scaled
pre-alpha moment phase, it dynamically schedules slow thinking transitions
by modeling the insertion of reasoning transition tokens as a Bernoulli
stochastic process. After the alpha moment, alpha1 deterministically
terminates slow thinking with the end-of-thinking token, thereby fostering fast
reasoning and efficient answer generation. This approach unifies and
generalizes existing monotonic scaling methods by enabling flexible and dense
slow-to-fast reasoning modulation. Extensive empirical studies on various
challenging benchmarks across mathematical, coding, and scientific domains
demonstrate alpha1's superior reasoning capability and efficiency. Project

   title: MultiFinBen: A Multilingual, Multimodal, and Difficulty-Aware Benchmark
  for Financial LLM Evaluation
   summary: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress in
financial NLP and applications, yet existing benchmarks remain limited to
monolingual and unimodal settings, often over-relying on simple tasks and
failing to reflect the complexity of real-world financial communication. We
introduce MultiFinBen, the first multilingual and multimodal benchmark tailored
to the global financial domain, evaluating LLMs across modalities (text,
vision, audio) and linguistic settings (monolingual, bilingual, multilingual)
on domain-specific tasks. We introduce two novel tasks, including PolyFiQA-Easy
and PolyFiQA-Expert, the first multilingual financial benchmarks requiring
models to perform complex reasoning over mixed-language inputs; and EnglishOCR
and SpanishOCR, the first OCR-embedded financial QA tasks challenging models to
extract and reason over information from visual-text financial documents.
Moreover, we propose a dynamic, difficulty-aware selection mechanism and curate
a compact, balanced benchmark rather than simple aggregation existing datasets.
Extensive evaluation of 22 state-of-the-art models reveals that even the
strongest models, despite their general multimodal and multilingual
capabilities, struggle dramatically when faced with complex cross-lingual and
multimodal tasks in financial domain. MultiFinBen is publicly released to
foster transparent, reproducible, and inclusive progress in financial studies
and applications.

   title: MiniCPM4: Ultra-Efficient LLMs on End Devices
   summary: This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM)
designed explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through
systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training
data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of
model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention
mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context
processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and
accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,
a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable
satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training
tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient
pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by
introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and
data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose
CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative
sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse
on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B
parameters, respectively. Sufficient evaluation results show that MiniCPM4
outperforms open-source models of similar size across multiple benchmarks,
highlighting both its efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, MiniCPM4-8B
demonstrates significant speed improvements over Qwen3-8B when processing long
sequences. Through further adaptation, MiniCPM4 successfully powers diverse
applications, including trustworthy survey generation and tool use with model
context protocol, clearly showcasing its broad usability.

   title: Light of Normals: Unified Feature Representation for Universal
  Photometric Stereo
   summary: Universal photometric stereo (PS) aims to recover high-quality surface
normals from objects under arbitrary lighting conditions without relying on
specific illumination models. Despite recent advances such as SDM-UniPS and Uni
MS-PS, two fundamental challenges persist: 1) the deep coupling between varying
illumination and surface normal features, where ambiguity in observed intensity
makes it difficult to determine whether brightness variations stem from
lighting changes or surface orientation; and 2) the preservation of
high-frequency geometric details in complex surfaces, where intricate
geometries create self-shadowing, inter-reflections, and subtle normal
variations that conventional feature processing operations struggle to capture
accurately.

   title: Vision-Guided Chunking Is All You Need: Enhancing RAG with Multimodal
  Document Understanding
   summary: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have revolutionized information
retrieval and question answering, but traditional text-based chunking methods
struggle with complex document structures, multi-page tables, embedded figures,
and contextual dependencies across page boundaries. We present a novel
multimodal document chunking approach that leverages Large Multimodal Models
(LMMs) to process PDF documents in batches while maintaining semantic coherence
and structural integrity. Our method processes documents in configurable page
batches with cross-batch context preservation, enabling accurate handling of
tables spanning multiple pages, embedded visual elements, and procedural
content. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of PDF documents with
manually crafted queries, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and
downstream RAG performance. Our vision-guided approach achieves better accuracy
compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing
superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.

   title: PartCrafter: Structured 3D Mesh Generation via Compositional Latent
  Diffusion Transformers
   summary: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that
jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct
3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce
monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an
image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,
compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented
inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D
parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and
complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh
diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained
weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A
compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of
disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables
structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,
ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.
To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level
annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that
PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D
meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,
demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding
and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.

   title: Time Blindness: Why Video-Language Models Can't See What Humans Can?
   summary: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made impressive strides
in understanding spatio-temporal relationships in videos. However, when spatial
information is obscured, these models struggle to capture purely temporal
patterns. We introduce SpookyBench, a benchmark where information is
encoded solely in temporal sequences of noise-like frames, mirroring natural
phenomena from biological signaling to covert communication. Interestingly,
while humans can recognize shapes, text, and patterns in these sequences with
over 98% accuracy, state-of-the-art VLMs achieve 0% accuracy. This performance
gap highlights a critical limitation: an over-reliance on frame-level spatial
features and an inability to extract meaning from temporal cues. Furthermore,
when trained in data sets with low spatial signal-to-noise ratios (SNR),
temporal understanding of models degrades more rapidly than human perception,
especially in tasks requiring fine-grained temporal reasoning. Overcoming this
limitation will require novel architectures or training paradigms that decouple
spatial dependencies from temporal processing. Our systematic analysis shows
that this issue persists across model scales and architectures. We release
SpookyBench to catalyze research in temporal pattern recognition and bridge the
gap between human and machine video understanding. Dataset and code has been
made available on our project website: https://timeblindness.github.io/.

   title: OmniGen2: Exploration to Advanced Multimodal Generation
   summary: In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative
model designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks,
including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike
OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image
modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This
design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models
without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text
generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed
comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and
in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism
tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset
based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2
achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including
text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,
also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named
OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code,
datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this
field. Project Page: https://vectorspacelab.github.io/OmniGen2; GitHub Link:

   title: Qwen3 Embedding: Advancing Text Embedding and Reranking Through
  Foundation Models
   summary: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are
publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

   title: FineWeb2: One Pipeline to Scale Them All -- Adapting Pre-Training Data
  Processing to Every Language
   summary: Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast
amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large
high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent
progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large
part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication
pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new
pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be
automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our
pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of
meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel
selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our
pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant
models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and
principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both
duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.
Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common
Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)
multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and

   title: REASONING GYM: Reasoning Environments for Reinforcement Learning with
  Verifiable Rewards
   summary: We introduce Reasoning Gym (RG), a library of reasoning environments for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. It provides over 100 data
generators and verifiers spanning multiple domains including algebra,
arithmetic, computation, cognition, geometry, graph theory, logic, and various
common games. Its key innovation is the ability to generate virtually infinite
training data with adjustable complexity, unlike most previous reasoning
datasets, which are typically fixed. This procedural generation approach allows
for continuous evaluation across varying difficulty levels. Our experimental
results demonstrate the efficacy of RG in both evaluating and reinforcement
learning of reasoning models.

   title: DeepResearch Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Deep Research Agents
   summary: Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By
autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and
higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into
analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research
into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating
the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present
DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks,
each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.
Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose
two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The
first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality
of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate
DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its
effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced
DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at
https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the
development of practical LLM-based agents.
   id: 2506.11763

   title: Scientists' First Exam: Probing Cognitive Abilities of MLLM via
  Perception, Understanding, and Reasoning
   summary: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

   title: Saffron-1: Towards an Inference Scaling Paradigm for LLM Safety
  Assurance
   summary: Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase
alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have
exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.
Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning
capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.
Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and
effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional
inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform
poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like
Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified
challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high
computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)
evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference
scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our
approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that
significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To
operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision
training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to
prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value
caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree
search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.
Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model
(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)
to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project
homepage is at https://q-rz.github.io/p/saffron .

   title: Matrix-Game: Interactive World Foundation Model
   summary: We introduce Matrix-Game, an interactive world foundation model for
controllable game world generation. Matrix-Game is trained using a two-stage
pipeline that first performs large-scale unlabeled pretraining for environment
understanding, followed by action-labeled training for interactive video
generation. To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive
Minecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips
and over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard
and mouse action annotations. Our model adopts a controllable image-to-world
generation paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user
actions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control
over character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual
quality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld
Score, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action
controllability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world
generation. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently
outperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and
MineWorld) across all metrics, with particularly strong gains in
controllability and physical consistency. Double-blind human evaluations
further confirm the superiority of Matrix-Game, highlighting its ability to
generate perceptually realistic and precisely controllable videos across
diverse game scenarios. To facilitate future research on interactive
image-to-world generation, we will open-source the Matrix-Game model weights
and the GameWorld Score benchmark at https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Matrix-Game.

   title: Geopolitical biases in LLMs: what are the "good" and the "bad" countries
  according to contemporary language models
   summary: This paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs with respect to various
countries though an analysis of their interpretation of historical events with
conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, and China). We introduce a
novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from
different countries. Our findings show significant geopolitical biases, with
models favoring specific national narratives. Additionally, simple debiasing
prompts had a limited effect in reducing these biases. Experiments with
manipulated participant labels reveal models' sensitivity to attribution,
sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies, especially with
swapped labels. This work highlights national narrative biases in LLMs,
challenges the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods, and offers a
framework and dataset for future geopolitical bias research.

   ai_summary: LLMs exhibit significant geopolitical biases in their interpretation of historical events, and simple debiasing methods have limited effectiveness; a novel dataset for further research is provided.

   title: ShareGPT-4o-Image: Aligning Multimodal Models with GPT-4o-Level Image
  Generation
   summary: Recent advances in multimodal generative models have unlocked photorealistic,
instruction-aligned image generation, yet leading systems like GPT-4o-Image
remain proprietary and inaccessible. To democratize these capabilities, we
present ShareGPT-4o-Image, the first dataset comprising 45K text-to-image and
46K text-and-image-to-image data, all synthesized using GPT-4o's image
generation capabilities for distilling its advanced image generation abilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we develop Janus-4o, a multimodal large language model
capable of both text-to-image and text-and-image-to-image generation. Janus-4o
not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor,
Janus-Pro, but also newly supports text-and-image-to-image generation. Notably,
it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from
scratch, using only 91K synthetic samples and 6 hours of training on an 8
A800-GPU machine. We hope the release of ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o will
foster open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.

   ai_summary: ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o enable open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation through a large dataset and multimodal model.

   title: Magistral
   summary: We introduce Magistral, Mistral's first reasoning model and our own scalable
reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. Instead of relying on existing
implementations and RL traces distilled from prior models, we follow a ground
up approach, relying solely on our own models and infrastructure. Notably, we
demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training
of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model,
and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's
capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal
understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral
Medium, trained for reasoning on top of Mistral Medium 3 with RL alone, and we
open-source Magistral Small (Apache 2.0) which further includes cold-start data
from Magistral Medium.
   id: 2506.10910
   ai_summary: Magistral, a scalable reinforcement learning pipeline, demonstrates that RL can enhance multimodal understanding and instruction following in large language models without requiring existing RL traces.

   title: Sekai: A Video Dataset towards World Exploration
   summary: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

   ai_summary: Sekai, a worldwide video dataset with comprehensive annotations, is introduced to support world exploration applications, enhancing video generation models.

   title: JarvisArt: Liberating Human Artistic Creativity via an Intelligent Photo
  Retouching Agent
   summary: Photo retouching has become integral to contemporary visual storytelling,
enabling users to capture aesthetics and express creativity. While professional
tools such as Adobe Lightroom offer powerful capabilities, they demand
substantial expertise and manual effort. In contrast, existing AI-based
solutions provide automation but often suffer from limited adjustability and
poor generalization, failing to meet diverse and personalized editing needs. To
bridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process
of professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching
tools within Lightroom. JarvisArt undergoes a two-stage training process: an
initial Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning to establish basic reasoning
and tool-use skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for
Retouching (GRPO-R) to further enhance its decision-making and tool
proficiency. We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate
seamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop
MMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits.
JarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and
fine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new
avenue for intelligent photo retouching. Notably, it outperforms GPT-4o with a
60% improvement in average pixel-level metrics on MMArt-Bench for content
fidelity, while maintaining comparable instruction-following capabilities.

   title: BlenderFusion: 3D-Grounded Visual Editing and Generative Compositing
   summary: We present BlenderFusion, a generative visual compositing framework that
synthesizes new scenes by recomposing objects, camera, and background. It
follows a layering-editing-compositing pipeline: (i) segmenting and converting
visual inputs into editable 3D entities (layering), (ii) editing them in
Blender with 3D-grounded control (editing), and (iii) fusing them into a
coherent scene using a generative compositor (compositing). Our generative
compositor extends a pre-trained diffusion model to process both the original
(source) and edited (target) scenes in parallel. It is fine-tuned on video
frames with two key training strategies: (i) source masking, enabling flexible
modifications like background replacement; (ii) simulated object jittering,
facilitating disentangled control over objects and camera. BlenderFusion
significantly outperforms prior methods in complex compositional scene editing
tasks.

   title: Scaling Test-time Compute for LLM Agents
   summary: Scaling test time compute has shown remarkable success in improving the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we conduct
the first systematic exploration of applying test-time scaling methods to
language agents and investigate the extent to which it improves their
effectiveness. Specifically, we explore different test-time scaling strategies,
including: (1) parallel sampling algorithms; (2) sequential revision
strategies; (3) verifiers and merging methods; (4)strategies for diversifying
rollouts.We carefully analyze and ablate the impact of different design
strategies on applying test-time scaling on language agents, and have follow
findings: 1. Scaling test time compute could improve the performance of agents.
2. Knowing when to reflect is important for agents. 3. Among different
verification and result merging approaches, the list-wise method performs best.
4. Increasing diversified rollouts exerts a positive effect on the agent's task
performance.

   title: AnimaX: Animating the Inanimate in 3D with Joint Video-Pose Diffusion
  Models
   summary: We present AnimaX, a feed-forward 3D animation framework that bridges the
motion priors of video diffusion models with the controllable structure of
skeleton-based animation. Traditional motion synthesis methods are either
restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in
high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers
video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated
meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,
multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on
template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional
encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment
between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to
motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are
triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via
inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged
sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in
generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution
for category-agnostic 3D animation. Project page:

   title: PAROAttention: Pattern-Aware ReOrdering for Efficient Sparse and
  Quantized Attention in Visual Generation Models
   summary: In visual generation, the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms
results in high memory and computational costs, especially for longer token
sequences required in high-resolution image or multi-frame video generation. To
address this, prior research has explored techniques such as sparsification and
quantization. However, these techniques face significant challenges under low
density and reduced bitwidths. Through systematic analysis, we identify that
the core difficulty stems from the dispersed and irregular characteristics of
visual attention patterns. Therefore, instead of introducing specialized
sparsification and quantization design to accommodate such patterns, we propose
an alternative strategy: *reorganizing* the attention pattern to alleviate the
challenges. Inspired by the local aggregation nature of visual feature
extraction, we design a novel **Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)**
technique, which unifies the diverse attention patterns into a
hardware-friendly block-wise pattern. This unification substantially simplifies
and enhances both sparsification and quantization. We evaluate the
performance-efficiency trade-offs of various design choices and finalize a
methodology tailored for the unified pattern. Our approach, **PAROAttention**,
achieves video and image generation with lossless metrics, and nearly identical
results from full-precision (FP) baselines, while operating at notably lower
density (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (**INT8/INT4**), achieving a **1.9x** to
**2.7x** end-to-end latency speedup.
   id: 2506.16054
   ai_summary: PAROAttention reorganizes visual attention patterns to enable efficient sparsification and quantization, reducing memory and computational costs with minimal impact on performance.

   title: The Common Pile v0.1: An 8TB Dataset of Public Domain and Openly
  Licensed Text
   summary: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

   title: SeedVR2: One-Step Video Restoration via Diffusion Adversarial
  Post-Training
   summary: Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate
significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive
computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based
approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,
extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,
particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,
which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the
challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several
enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,
an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is
dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window
inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a
predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training
towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,
including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing
training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve
comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a
single step.
   id: 2506.05301
   ai_summary: SeedVR2 is a one-step diffusion-based video restoration model that uses adaptive window attention and feature matching loss to achieve high visual quality with reduced computational cost compared to existing methods.

   title: UniWorld: High-Resolution Semantic Encoders for Unified Visual
  Understanding and Generation
   summary: Although existing unified models deliver strong performance on
vision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, their models are
limited in exploring image perception and manipulation tasks, which are
urgently desired by users for wide applications. Recently, OpenAI released
their powerful GPT-4o-Image model for comprehensive image perception and
manipulation, achieving expressive capability and attracting community
interests. By observing the performance of GPT-4o-Image in our carefully
constructed experiments, we infer that GPT-4o-Image leverages features
extracted by semantic encoders instead of VAE, while VAEs are considered
essential components in many image manipulation models. Motivated by such
inspiring observations, we present a unified generative framework named
UniWorld based on semantic features provided by powerful visual-language models
and contrastive semantic encoders. As a result, we build a strong unified model
using only 1% amount of BAGEL's data, which consistently outperforms BAGEL on
image editing benchmarks. UniWorld also maintains competitive image
understanding and generation capabilities, achieving strong performance across
multiple image perception tasks. We fully open-source our models, including
model weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets.

   title: VS-Bench: Evaluating VLMs for Strategic Reasoning and Decision-Making in
  Multi-Agent Environments
   summary: Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have expanded their
capabilities to interactive agent tasks, yet existing benchmarks remain limited
to single-agent or text-only environments. In contrast, real-world scenarios
often involve multiple agents interacting within rich visual and linguistic
contexts, posing challenges with both multimodal observations and strategic
interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Visual Strategic Bench
(VS-Bench), a multimodal benchmark that evaluates VLMs for strategic reasoning
and decision-making in multi-agent environments. VS-Bench comprises eight
vision-grounded environments spanning cooperative, competitive, and
mixed-motive interactions, designed to assess agents' ability to predict
others' future moves and optimize for long-term objectives. We consider two
complementary evaluation dimensions, including offline evaluation of strategic
reasoning by next-action prediction accuracy and online evaluation of
decision-making by normalized episode return. Extensive experiments of fourteen
leading VLMs reveal a significant gap between current models and optimal
performance, with the best models attaining 47.8% prediction accuracy and 24.3%
normalized return. We further conduct in-depth analyses on multimodal
observations, test-time scaling, social behaviors, and failure cases of VLM
agents. By standardizing the evaluation and highlighting the limitations of
existing models, we envision VS-Bench as a foundation for future research on
strategic multimodal agents. Code and data are available at
https://vs-bench.github.io.

   title: Hunyuan-GameCraft: High-dynamic Interactive Game Video Generation with
  Hybrid History Condition
   summary: Recent advances in diffusion-based and controllable video generation have
enabled high-quality and temporally coherent video synthesis, laying the
groundwork for immersive interactive gaming experiences. However, current
methods face limitations in dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and
efficiency, which limit the ability to create various gameplay videos. To
address these gaps, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft, a novel framework for
high-dynamic interactive video generation in game environments. To achieve
fine-grained action control, we unify standard keyboard and mouse inputs into a
shared camera representation space, facilitating smooth interpolation between
various camera and movement operations. Then we propose a hybrid
history-conditioned training strategy that extends video sequences
autoregressively while preserving game scene information. Additionally, to
enhance inference efficiency and playability, we achieve model distillation to
reduce computational overhead while maintaining consistency across long
temporal sequences, making it suitable for real-time deployment in complex
interactive environments. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset
comprising over one million gameplay recordings across over 100 AAA games,
ensuring broad coverage and diversity, then fine-tuned on a carefully annotated
synthetic dataset to enhance precision and control. The curated game scene data
significantly improves the visual fidelity, realism and action controllability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hunyuan-GameCraft significantly
outperforms existing models, advancing the realism and playability of
interactive game video generation.
   id: 2506.17201

   title: LongWriter-Zero: Mastering Ultra-Long Text Generation via Reinforcement
  Learning
   summary: Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded
scenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum
generation length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length
increases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on
''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic
long-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT
data, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and
consistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In
this work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely
from scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages
reinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality
text generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a
base model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that
facilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support
this, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved
length control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental
evaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,
achieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and
Arena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and
Qwen3-235B. We open-source our data and model checkpoints under
https://huggingface.co/THU-KEG/LongWriter-Zero-32B

   title: Multiverse: Your Language Models Secretly Decide How to Parallelize and
  Merge Generation
   summary: Autoregressive Large Language Models (AR-LLMs) frequently exhibit implicit
parallelism in sequential generation. Inspired by this, we introduce
Multiverse, a new generative model that enables natively parallel generation.
Multiverse internalizes a MapReduce paradigm, generating automatically through
three stages: (i) a Map stage for adaptive task decomposition, (ii) a Process
stage for parallel subtask execution, and (iii) a Reduce stage for lossless
result synthesis. Next, we build a real-world Multiverse reasoning model with
co-design of data, algorithm, and system, enabling rapid and seamless transfer
from frontier AR-LLMs. Starting from sequential reasoning chains, we create
Multiverse 1K by converting them into structured training data using an
automated LLM-assisted pipeline, avoiding costly human annotations.
Algorithmically, we design Multiverse Attention to separate parallel reasoning
steps while keeping compatibility with causal attention for efficient training.
Systematically, we implement Multiverse Engine to enable parallel inference. It
features a dedicated scheduler that dynamically switches between sequential and
parallel generation, triggered directly by the model. After a 3-hour
fine-tuning with 1K examples, our Multiverse-32B stands as the only
open-sourced non-AR model achieving performance on par with leading AR-LLMs of
the same scale, evidenced by AIME24 & 25 scores of 54% and 46%, respectively.
Moreover, our budget control experiments show that Multiverse-32B exhibits
superior scaling, outperforming AR-LLMs by 1.87% on average using the same
context length. Such scaling further leads to practical efficiency gain,
achieving up to 2x speedup across varying batch sizes. We have open-sourced the
entire Multiverse ecosystem, including data, model weights, engine, supporting
tools, as well as complete data curation prompts and detailed training and
evaluation recipes.

   title: Video World Models with Long-term Spatial Memory
   summary: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to
actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control
signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often
struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe
forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of
human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency
of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our
framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the
long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate
world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show
improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant
baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

  Following
   summary: Recent advances in audio-text large language models (LLMs) have opened new
possibilities for music understanding and generation. However, existing
benchmarks are limited in scope, often relying on simplified tasks or
multi-choice evaluations that fail to reflect the complexity of real-world
music analysis. We reinterpret a broad range of traditional MIR annotations as
instruction-following formats and introduce CMI-Bench, a comprehensive music
instruction following benchmark designed to evaluate audio-text LLMs on a
diverse set of music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. These include genre
classification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification,
pitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal
technique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music
tagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges
in MIR research. Unlike previous benchmarks, CMI-Bench adopts standardized
evaluation metrics consistent with previous state-of-the-art MIR models,
ensuring direct comparability with supervised approaches. We provide an
evaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including
LTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant
performance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture,
chronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of
current models in addressing MIR tasks. CMI-Bench establishes a unified
foundation for evaluating music instruction following, driving progress in
music-aware LLMs.

   title: Wait, We Don't Need to "Wait"! Removing Thinking Tokens Improves
  Reasoning Efficiency
   summary: Recent advances in large reasoning models have enabled complex, step-by-step
reasoning but often introduce significant overthinking, resulting in verbose
and redundant outputs that hinder efficiency. In this study, we examine whether
explicit self-reflection, signaled by tokens such as "Wait" and "Hmm", is
necessary for advanced reasoning. We propose NoWait, a simple yet effective
approach that disables explicit self-reflection by suppressing these tokens
during inference. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks across textual,
visual, and video reasoning tasks show that NoWait reduces chain-of-thought
trajectory length by up to 27%-51% in five R1-style model series, without
compromising model utility. NoWait thus offers a plug-and-play solution for
efficient and utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

   ai_summary: NoWait suppresses explicit self-reflection tokens during inference to enhance efficiency in multimodal reasoning without reducing model utility.

   title: Feedback Friction: LLMs Struggle to Fully Incorporate External Feedback
   summary: Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their
responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how
effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In
an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would
expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers
to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to
incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For
each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator
with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,
after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse
range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific
reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language
models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,
even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show
resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To
mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like
progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously
attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help
models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of
potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model
overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in
LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in
self-improvement.

   title: ComfyUI-R1: Exploring Reasoning Models for Workflow Generation
   summary: AI-generated content has evolved from monolithic models to modular workflows,
particularly on platforms like ComfyUI, enabling customization in creative
pipelines. However, crafting effective workflows requires great expertise to
orchestrate numerous specialized components, presenting a steep learning curve
for users. To address this challenge, we introduce ComfyUI-R1, the first large
reasoning model for automated workflow generation. Starting with our curated
dataset of 4K workflows, we construct long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
data, including node selection, workflow planning, and code-level workflow
representation. ComfyUI-R1 is trained through a two-stage framework: (1) CoT
fine-tuning for cold start, adapting models to the ComfyUI domain; (2)
reinforcement learning for incentivizing reasoning capability, guided by a
fine-grained rule-metric hybrid reward, ensuring format validity, structural
integrity, and node-level fidelity. Experiments show that our 7B-parameter
model achieves a 97\% format validity rate, along with high pass rate,
node-level and graph-level F1 scores, significantly surpassing prior
state-of-the-art methods that employ leading closed-source models such as
GPT-4o and Claude series. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the
reasoning process and the advantage of transforming workflows into code.
Qualitative comparison reveals our strength in synthesizing intricate workflows
with diverse nodes, underscoring the potential of long CoT reasoning in AI art
creation.

   title: Group Sequence Policy Optimization
   summary: This paper introduces Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), our stable,
efficient, and performant reinforcement learning algorithm for training large
language models. Unlike previous algorithms that adopt token-level importance
ratios, GSPO defines the importance ratio based on sequence likelihood and
performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate
that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the
GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and
has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits
of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3
models.

   title: A Survey of Context Engineering for Large Language Models
   summary: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined
by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces
Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design
to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We
present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its
foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate
them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:
context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We
then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create
sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through
this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only
establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical
research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While
current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate
remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit
pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.
Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,
this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers
advancing context-aware AI.

   title: GLM-4.1V-Thinking: Towards Versatile Multimodal Reasoning with Scalable
  Reinforcement Learning
   summary: We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to
advance general-purpose multimodal reasoning. In this report, we share our key
findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We
first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential
through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the
final performance. Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) then
unlocks the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability
enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving,
video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents,
and long document understanding, among others. To facilitate research in this
field, we open-source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, which achieves state-of-the-art
performance among models of comparable size. In a comprehensive evaluation
across 28 public benchmarks, our model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on nearly all
tasks and achieves comparable or even superior performance on 18 benchmarks
relative to the significantly larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Notably,
GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking also demonstrates competitive or superior performance
compared to closed-source models such as GPT-4o on challenging tasks including
long document understanding and STEM reasoning, further underscoring its strong
capabilities. Code, models and more information are released at

   title: Scaling RL to Long Videos
   summary: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

   title: Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization
   summary: Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language
models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning
scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving
processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'
intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in
multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced
Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training
multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that
LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in
the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following
interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO
incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing
global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting
exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an
advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage
differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13
challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and
deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL
algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of
the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution
for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and
datasets are released at https://github.com/dongguanting/ARPO

   title: MemOS: A Memory OS for AI System
   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory
management systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual
personalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on
static parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to
track user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain
text, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or
integration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the
training and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective,
showing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and
external retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing
specific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader
challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context,
requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning
different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose
MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system
resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of
plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling
cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates
both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes
can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions
between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning.
MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings
controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation
for continual learning and personalized modeling.

   title: HunyuanWorld 1.0: Generating Immersive, Explorable, and Interactive 3D
  Worlds from Words or Pixels
   summary: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a
fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world
generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods
that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and
3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited
training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these
limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the
best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D
scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key
advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)
mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer
graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented
interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh
representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for
semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation
of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and
interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality,
physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.

   title: MiroMind-M1: An Open-Source Advancement in Mathematical Reasoning via
  Context-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization
   summary: Large language models have recently evolved from fluent text generation to
advanced reasoning across diverse domains, giving rise to reasoning language
models. Among these domains, mathematical reasoning serves as a representative
benchmark as it requires precise multi-step logic and abstract reasoning, which
can be generalized to other tasks. While closed-source RLMs such as GPT-o3
demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, their proprietary nature limits
transparency and reproducibility. Although many open-source projects aim to
close this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical
resources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders
reproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development,
we introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on
the Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing
open-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a
carefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT
trajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To
enhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce
Context-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates
length-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage
context-aware RL training. Our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive
performance and superior token efficiency among Qwen-2.5-based open-source 7B
and 32B models on the AIME24, AIME25, and MATH benchmarks. To facilitate
reproducibility, we release the complete stack: models (MiroMind-M1-SFT-7B,
MiroMind-M1-RL-7B, MiroMind-M1-RL-32B); datasets (MiroMind-M1-SFT-719K,
MiroMind-M1-RL-62K); and all training and evaluation configurations. We hope
these resources will support further research and foster community advancement.

   title: GUI-G^2: Gaussian Reward Modeling for GUI Grounding
   summary: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding maps natural language instructions
to precise interface locations for autonomous interaction. Current
reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as
hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature
of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally
forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI
Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G^2), a principled reward framework that
models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface
plane. GUI-G^2 incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point
rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions
centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment
by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target
regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance
mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions.
This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to
dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich
gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions.
Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro
benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G^2, substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of
24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides
superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to
unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI
interaction tasks.

   title: Kwai Keye-VL Technical Report
   summary: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities on static images, they often fall short in comprehending dynamic,
information-dense short-form videos, a dominant medium in today's digital
landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce Kwai Keye-VL, an
8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge
performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust
general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on
two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens
with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe
features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,
followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first
post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction
following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In
this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data
mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think
with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to
decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and
alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct
abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach,
we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves
state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly
competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop
and release the KC-MMBench, a new benchmark tailored for real-world
short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.

   title: nablaNABLA: Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention
   summary: Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated
remarkable success in video generation tasks. However, the quadratic complexity
of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for
high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose
NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that
dynamically adapts to sparsity patterns in video diffusion transformers (DiTs).
By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold,
NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our
method does not require custom low-level operator design and can be seamlessly
integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that
NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline
almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score,
human evaluation score) and visual quality drop. The code and model weights are
available here: https://github.com/gen-ai-team/Wan2.1-NABLA

   title: WebSailor: Navigating Super-human Reasoning for Web Agent
   summary: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

   title: Beyond Context Limits: Subconscious Threads for Long-Horizon Reasoning
   summary: To break the context limits of large language models (LLMs) that bottleneck
reasoning accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Thread Inference Model (TIM),
a family of LLMs trained for recursive and decompositional problem solving, and
TIMRUN, an inference runtime enabling long-horizon structured reasoning beyond
context limits. Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited
working memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model
inference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and
GPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as
reasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences.
The reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and
conclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During
generation, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states
of the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning
mechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages
throughout reasoning. Experimental results show that our system sustains high
inference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU
memory. It also delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks and handles
information retrieval challenges that require long-horizon reasoning and
multi-hop tool use.

   title: T-LoRA: Single Image Diffusion Model Customization Without Overfitting
   summary: While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing
pre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from
overfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization
capability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most
impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image,
as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We
introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework
specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show
that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones,
necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates
two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts
rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight
parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components
through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and
its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model
personalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept
fidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in
data-limited and resource-constrained scenarios. Code is available at
https://github.com/ControlGenAI/T-LoRA.

   title: SingLoRA: Low Rank Adaptation Using a Single Matrix
   summary: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights
of a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a
low-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities
between these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates
low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a
single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design
inherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization,
and roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the
infinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable
feature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks
validate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on
MNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+
(90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation,
fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image
fidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to
scores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.

   title: Test-Time Scaling with Reflective Generative Model
   summary: We introduce our first reflective generative model MetaStone-S1, which
obtains OpenAI o3's performance via the self-supervised process reward model
(SPRM). Through sharing the backbone network and using task-specific heads for
next token prediction and process scoring respectively, SPRM successfully
integrates the policy model and process reward model(PRM) into a unified
interface without extra process annotation, reducing over 99% PRM parameters
for efficient reasoning. Equipped with SPRM, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable
for test time scaling (TTS), and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low,
medium, and high), based on the controllable thinking length. Moreover, we
empirically establish a scaling law that reveals the relationship between total
thinking computation and TTS performance. Experiments demonstrate that our
MetaStone-S1 achieves comparable performance to OpenAI-o3-mini's series with
only 32B parameter size. To support the research community, we have
open-sourced MetaStone-S1 at https://github.com/MetaStone-AI/MetaStone-S1.

   title: 4KAgent: Agentic Any Image to 4K Super-Resolution
   summary: We present 4KAgent, a unified agentic super-resolution generalist system
designed to universally upscale any image to 4K resolution (and even higher, if
applied iteratively). Our system can transform images from extremely low
resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at
256x256, into crystal-clear, photorealistic 4K outputs. 4KAgent comprises three
core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline
based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages
vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze
the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration
Agent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection
paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the
optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face
restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and
selfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task
categories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new

   title: ScreenCoder: Advancing Visual-to-Code Generation for Front-End
  Automation via Modular Multimodal Agents
   summary: Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end
code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and
democratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely
solely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing
spatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in
practice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or
mockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that
performs UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,
planning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to
detect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical
layout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces
HTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves
robustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.
Furthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that
automatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic
examples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains
in UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy,
structural coherence, and code correctness. Our code is made publicly available
at https://github.com/leigest519/ScreenCoder.

   title: A Survey on Latent Reasoning
   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both
interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning
limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this
bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's
continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent
reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role
of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,
highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.
Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including
activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning
strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we
discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked
diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning
processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual
landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the
frontier of LLM cognition. An associated GitHub repository collecting the
latest papers and repos is available at:

   title: Yume: An Interactive World Generation Model
   summary: Yume aims to use images, text, or videos to create an interactive, realistic,
and dynamic world, which allows exploration and control using peripheral
devices or neural signals. In this report, we present a preview version of
\method, which creates a dynamic world from an input image and allows
exploration of the world using keyboard actions. To achieve this high-fidelity
and interactive video world generation, we introduce a well-designed framework,
which consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization,
video generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First,
we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction
using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion
Transformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an
autoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM)
and Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE)
are introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise
control. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic
optimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the
high-quality world exploration dataset \sekai to train \method, and it achieves
remarkable results in diverse scenes and applications. All data, codebase, and
model weights are available on https://github.com/stdstu12/YUME. Yume will
update monthly to achieve its original goal. Project page:

   title: Reasoning or Memorization? Unreliable Results of Reinforcement Learning
  Due to Data Contamination
   summary: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a
longstanding focus of research. Recent works have further enhanced these
capabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming
significant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly,
some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance
reasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the
Qwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500,
AMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like
Llama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although
Qwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on
large-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular
benchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be
unreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully
synthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a
clean dataset we call RandomCalculation. Using these leakage-free datasets, we
show that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while
noisy or incorrect signals do not. We advocate for evaluating RL methods on
uncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure
trustworthy conclusions.

   ai_summary: Research on enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models using reinforcement learning reveals that accurate reward signals are crucial for performance improvement, and current benchmarks may be unreliable due to data contamination.

   title: Thinking with Images for Multimodal Reasoning: Foundations, Methods, and
  Future Frontiers
   summary: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been significantly advanced by
textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning
within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a
static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich
perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends
language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution
is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that
merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This
emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as
intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive
input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart
this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive
autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool
exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To
structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions.
(1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm
and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the
core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the
critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications.
(4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions.
By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for
future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.

   title: Towards Agentic RAG with Deep Reasoning: A Survey of RAG-Reasoning
  Systems in LLMs
   summary: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems
that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented
approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both
strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how
advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then,
we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and
expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we
spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs
iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art
performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods,
datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper
RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive,
trustworthy, and human-centric. The collection is available at
https://github.com/DavidZWZ/Awesome-RAG-Reasoning.

   title: The Invisible Leash: Why RLVR May Not Escape Its Origin
   summary: Recent advances in large reasoning models highlight Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a promising method for enhancing AI's
capabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it
remains unclear whether RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or
merely amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for
improved precision. This study presents a theoretical and empirical
investigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.
First, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the
base model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial
probability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may
restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an
entropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may
progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet
underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while
RLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally
outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,
failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base
model. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases
token-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,
answer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain
paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken
together, these findings reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning
horizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic
innovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that
seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.

   ai_summary: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances precision but may limit exploration and discovery of new solutions, suggesting potential limits to its effectiveness in expanding reasoning capabilities.

   title: A Survey of Self-Evolving Agents: On Path to Artificial Super
  Intelligence
   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain
fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks,
evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are
increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static
nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can
adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from
scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing
interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and
adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the
first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized
around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how
to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,
models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages
(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and
architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,
textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we
analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,
highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,
and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,
scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework
for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a
roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world
deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of
Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,
performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.

   title: NeuralOS: Towards Simulating Operating Systems via Neural Generative
  Models
   summary: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in
response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.
NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for
future human-computer interaction systems.

   title: Should We Still Pretrain Encoders with Masked Language Modeling?
   summary: Learning high-quality text representations is fundamental to a wide range of
NLP tasks. While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked
Language Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models
pretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as
encoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation
benchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent
advantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model
and data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of
large-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30
models ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over
15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM
generally yields better performance across text representation tasks,
CLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning
stability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic
training strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal
performance under a fixed computational training budget. Moreover, we
demonstrate that this strategy becomes more appealing when initializing from
readily available pretrained CLM models (from the existing LLM ecosystem),
reducing the computational burden needed to train best-in-class encoder models.
We release all project artifacts at https://hf.co/MLMvsCLM to foster further
research.

   title: MIRIX: Multi-Agent Memory System for LLM-Based Agents
   summary: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

   title: Does Math Reasoning Improve General LLM Capabilities? Understanding
  Transferability of LLM Reasoning
   summary: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language
models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on
benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week,
it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or
just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20
open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including
math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard
instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in
math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this
phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using
math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement
learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised
fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space
representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT
induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves
general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard
post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for
advancing reasoning models.

   title: VisionThink: Smart and Efficient Vision Language Model via Reinforcement
  Learning
   summary: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available
at https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionThink.

   title: LongAnimation: Long Animation Generation with Dynamic Global-Local
  Memory
   summary: Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry
production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,
automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has
significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term
colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features
to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local
paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color
consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can
be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically
extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.
Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly
includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color
Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support
the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to
dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with
the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce
a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency
fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both
short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the
effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color
consistency for open-domain animation colorization task. The code can be found
at https://cn-makers.github.io/long_animation_web/.

   title: Open Vision Reasoner: Transferring Linguistic Cognitive Behavior for
  Visual Reasoning
   summary: The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems
from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable
rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage
paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning,
followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps,
surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work
reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly
early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly
memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up
effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors
such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR),
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks,
including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We
release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of
more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.

   title: Step-Audio 2 Technical Report
   summary: This paper presents Step-Audio~2, an end-to-end multi-modal large language
model designed for industry-strength audio understanding and speech
conversation. By integrating a latent audio encoder and reasoning-centric
reinforcement learning (RL), Step-Audio 2 achieves promising performance in
automatic speech recognition (ASR) and audio understanding. To facilitate
genuine end-to-end speech conversation, Step-Audio 2 incorporates the
generation of discrete audio tokens into language modeling, significantly
enhancing its responsiveness to paralinguistic information such as speaking
styles and emotions. To effectively leverage the rich textual and acoustic
knowledge in real-world data, Step-Audio 2 integrates retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and is able to call external tools such as web search to
mitigate hallucination and audio search to switch timbres. Trained on millions
of hours of speech and audio data, Step-Audio 2 delivers intelligence and
expressiveness across diverse conversational scenarios. Evaluation results
demonstrate that Step-Audio 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various

   title: Skywork-R1V3 Technical Report
   summary: We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model
(VLM) that pioneers a new approach to visual reasoning. Its key innovation lies
in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language
Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily
stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively
activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for
additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover
the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal
alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique
indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens,
which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training.
Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving
from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities.
Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B
parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation
successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related
reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and
reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on
multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal
reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM
capabilities.

   title: Mixture-of-Recursions: Learning Dynamic Recursive Depths for Adaptive
  Token-Level Computation
   summary: Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying
computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive.
Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or
adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both
simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework
that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.
MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter
efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by
dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This
allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still
active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency
by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core
mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the
first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory
footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms
a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it
significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,
while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive
baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards
large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

   title: Falcon-H1: A Family of Hybrid-Head Language Models Redefining Efficiency
  and Performance
   summary: In this report, we introduce Falcon-H1, a new series of large language models
(LLMs) featuring hybrid architecture designs optimized for both high
performance and efficiency across diverse use cases. Unlike earlier Falcon
models built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a
parallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State
Space Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational
efficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and
training dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1
is released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned
variants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized
instruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on
Hugging Face Hub. Falcon-H1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and
exceptional parameter and training efficiency. The flagship Falcon-H1-34B
matches or outperforms models up to 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B,
and Llama3.3-70B, while using fewer parameters and less data. Smaller models
show similar trends: the Falcon-H1-1.5B-Deep rivals current leading 7B-10B
models, and Falcon-H1-0.5B performs comparably to typical 7B models from 2024.
These models excel across reasoning, mathematics, multilingual tasks,
instruction following, and scientific knowledge. With support for up to 256K
context tokens and 18 languages, Falcon-H1 is suitable for a wide range of
applications. All models are released under a permissive open-source license,
underscoring our commitment to accessible and impactful AI research.

   title: Energy-Based Transformers are Scalable Learners and Thinkers
   summary: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

   title: Pixels, Patterns, but No Poetry: To See The World like Humans
   summary: Achieving human-like perception and reasoning in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. While
recent research has primarily focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in
MLLMs, a fundamental question persists: Can Multimodal Large Language Models
truly perceive the world as humans do? This paper shifts focus from reasoning
to perception. Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning,
we introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented
benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on
synthetic images that humans process intuitively. Our findings reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on our perceptual tasks
trivial for humans. Both in-context learning and training on language
backbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our
tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting
that our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than
for the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap
between current MLLMs and human perception. We release a representative subset
of TET tasks in this version, and will introduce more diverse tasks and methods
to enhance visual generalization in future work.

   title: Deep Researcher with Test-Time Diffusion
   summary: Deep research agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly
advancing; yet, their performance often plateaus when generating complex,
long-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. Drawing
inspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles
of searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep
Researcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report
generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a
preliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation
to guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through
a "denoising" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism
that incorporates external information at each step. The core process is
further enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of
the agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the
diffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process
more timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative
search process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art
results on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and
multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents.
   id: 2507.16075
   ai_summary: TTD-DR, a diffusion-based framework, generates high-quality research reports by iteratively refining a preliminary draft with external information and self-evolutionary algorithms, outperforming existing deep research agents.

   title: π^3: Scalable Permutation-Equivariant Visual Geometry Learning
   summary: We introduce pi^3, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel
approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, pi^3
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.
   id: 2507.13347
   ai_summary: A permutation-equivariant neural network, $\pi^3$, reconstructs visual geometry without a fixed reference view, achieving state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, depth estimation, and point map reconstruction.

   title: BANG: Dividing 3D Assets via Generative Exploded Dynamics
   summary: 3D creation has always been a unique human strength, driven by our ability to
deconstruct and reassemble objects using our eyes, mind and hand. However,
current 3D design tools struggle to replicate this natural process, requiring
considerable artistic expertise and manual labor. This paper introduces BANG, a
novel generative approach that bridges 3D generation and reasoning, allowing
for intuitive and flexible part-level decomposition of 3D objects. At the heart
of BANG is "Generative Exploded Dynamics", which creates a smooth sequence of
exploded states for an input geometry, progressively separating parts while
preserving their geometric and semantic coherence.
  BANG utilizes a pre-trained large-scale latent diffusion model, fine-tuned
for exploded dynamics with a lightweight exploded view adapter, allowing
precise control over the decomposition process. It also incorporates a temporal
attention module to ensure smooth transitions and consistency across time. BANG
enhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface
regions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how. This
interaction can be extended with multimodal models like GPT-4, enabling
2D-to-3D manipulations for more intuitive and creative workflows.
  The capabilities of BANG extend to generating detailed part-level geometry,
associating parts with functional descriptions, and facilitating
component-aware 3D creation and manufacturing workflows. Additionally, BANG
offers applications in 3D printing, where separable parts are generated for
easy printing and reassembly. In essence, BANG enables seamless transformation
from imaginative concepts to detailed 3D assets, offering a new perspective on
creation that resonates with human intuition.

   title: The Devil behind the mask: An emergent safety vulnerability of Diffusion
  LLMs
   summary: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and
greater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling.
However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we
identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to
safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts,
exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first
systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety
weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial
interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of
dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional
modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked
spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic
filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard
alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned
dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed
in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA
significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously
overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves
up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior
baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and
by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of
harmful content in the jailbreak prompt. Our findings underscore the urgent
need for rethinking safety alignment in this emerging class of language models.

and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high
performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model
generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing
users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic
problem solving.

   title: MegaScience: Pushing the Frontiers of Post-Training Datasets for Science
  Reasoning
   summary: Scientific reasoning is critical for developing AI scientists and supporting
human researchers in advancing the frontiers of natural science discovery.
However, the open-source community has primarily focused on mathematics and
coding while neglecting the scientific domain, largely due to the absence of
open, large-scale, high-quality, verifiable scientific reasoning datasets. To
bridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring
truthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific
textbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific
disciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of
high-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed
through systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection
methodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available
scientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system
covering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks,
incorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate
evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve
superior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths
compared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train
Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which
significantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average
performance. In addition, MegaScience exhibits greater effectiveness for larger
and stronger models, suggesting a scaling benefit for scientific tuning. We
release our data curation pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and seven
trained models to the community to advance scientific reasoning research.

   title: Vision Foundation Models as Effective Visual Tokenizers for
  Autoregressive Image Generation
   summary: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

   title: Ovis-U1 Technical Report
   summary: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model
that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image
editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1
incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token
refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like
GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation
tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a
language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation
tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the
enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score
of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent
state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In
text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the
DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves
4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the
initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries
of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

   title: LangScene-X: Reconstruct Generalizable 3D Language-Embedded Scenes with
  TriMap Video Diffusion
   summary: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D
images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved
this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

   title: OmniPart: Part-Aware 3D Generation with Semantic Decoupling and
  Structural Cohesion
   summary: The creation of 3D assets with explicit, editable part structures is crucial
for advancing interactive applications, yet most generative methods produce
only monolithic shapes, limiting their utility. We introduce OmniPart, a novel
framework for part-aware 3D object generation designed to achieve high semantic
decoupling among components while maintaining robust structural cohesion.
OmniPart uniquely decouples this complex task into two synergistic stages: (1)
an autoregressive structure planning module generates a controllable,
variable-length sequence of 3D part bounding boxes, critically guided by
flexible 2D part masks that allow for intuitive control over part decomposition
without requiring direct correspondences or semantic labels; and (2) a
spatially-conditioned rectified flow model, efficiently adapted from a
pre-trained holistic 3D generator, synthesizes all 3D parts simultaneously and
consistently within the planned layout. Our approach supports user-defined part
granularity, precise localization, and enables diverse downstream applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art
performance, paving the way for more interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D
content.

   title: NoHumansRequired: Autonomous High-Quality Image Editing Triplet Mining
   summary: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that
follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their
supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,
edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect
only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical
plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated
edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an
automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,
resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative
models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned
Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,
removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and
compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,
enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most
repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training
without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this
resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k
high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses
all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source
fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our
experiments.

   title: SmallThinker: A Family of Efficient Large Language Models Natively
  Trained for Local Deployment
   summary: While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability
boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud
infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs
natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:
weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional
approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect
SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our
innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints
into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure
combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward
networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model
capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a
pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch
expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding
storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for
memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to
slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and
SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and
even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly
eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both
models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB
and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at
hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and

   title: DINOv3
   summary: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

   title: Qwen-Image Technical Report
   summary: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen
series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise
image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a
comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,
filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,
evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to
paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially
enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,
Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as
English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic
languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an
improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional
text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also
image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent
representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed
the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and
reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism
enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic
consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both
image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

   title: Intern-S1: A Scientific Multimodal Foundation Model
   summary: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

   title: Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens
   summary: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language
Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to
produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT
reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate
inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT
reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore
further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and
investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from
in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning
paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is
fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the
training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning
via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,
we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs
from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution
conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that
vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a
deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the
ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

   title: InternVL3.5: Advancing Open-Source Multimodal Models in Versatility,
  Reasoning, and Efficiency
   summary: We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that
significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference
efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade
Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through
a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for
refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial
improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To
optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that
dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising
performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)
strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,
effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively
enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning
performance and a 4.05times inference speedup compared to its predecessor,
i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as
GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e.,
InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs
across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the
performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code
are publicly released.

hybrid reasoning method that supports both thinking and direct response modes.
Through multi-stage training on 23T tokens and comprehensive post-training with

TAU-Bench, 91.0% on AIME 24, and 64.2% on SWE-bench Verified. With much fewer
parameters than several competitors, GLM-4.5 ranks 3rd overall among all
evaluated models and 2nd on agentic benchmarks. We release both GLM-4.5 (355B
parameters) and a compact version, GLM-4.5-Air (106B parameters), to advance
research in reasoning and agentic AI systems. Code, models, and more

   title: On the Generalization of SFT: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective with
  Reward Rectification
   summary: We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited
generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical
analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic
reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of
model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing
gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function
with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change
significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks

   title: VeriGUI: Verifiable Long-Chain GUI Dataset
   summary: Recent studies have delved into constructing autonomous agents capable of
performing complex Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based computer tasks, with
the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction. Despite encouraging
results, existing efforts mainly focus on short-term interactions and rely on
outcome-only verification, thereby limiting their scalability in real-world GUI
applications that demand long-horizon task decomposition and execution. In this
work, we introduce VeriGUI, a novel verifiable long-chain GUI dataset designed
to facilitate the development and evaluation of generalist GUI agents operating
in realistic computer environments. Our dataset emphasizes two critical
dimensions: (1) long-chain complexity, with tasks decomposed into a sequence of
interdependent subtasks spanning hundreds of steps, explicitly designed to
allow any subtask to serve as a valid starting point; and (2) subtask-level
verifiability, which enables diverse exploration strategies within each
subtask, while ensuring that each subtask-level goal remains verifiable and
consistent. The dataset consists of GUI task trajectories across both desktop
and web, annotated by human experts. Extensive experiments on VeriGUI using
various agents with different foundation models reveal significant performance
gaps in handling long-horizon tasks, highlighting the need for more robust
planning and decision-making capabilities in GUI agents.

   title: AgentFly: Fine-tuning LLM Agents without Fine-tuning LLMs
   summary: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation (87.88% Pass@3) and 79.40% on the test set. It reaches
66.6% F1 and 80.4% PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds 4.7% to
9.6% absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The
code is available at https://github.com/Agent-on-the-Fly/AgentFly.

   title: NextStep-1: Toward Autoregressive Image Generation with Continuous
  Tokens at Scale
   summary: Prevailing autoregressive (AR) models for text-to-image generation either
rely on heavy, computationally-intensive diffusion models to process continuous
image tokens, or employ vector quantization (VQ) to obtain discrete tokens with
quantization loss. In this paper, we push the autoregressive paradigm forward
with NextStep-1, a 14B autoregressive model paired with a 157M flow matching
head, training on discrete text tokens and continuous image tokens with
next-token prediction objectives. NextStep-1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance for autoregressive models in text-to-image generation tasks,
exhibiting strong capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. Furthermore,
our method shows strong performance in image editing, highlighting the power
and versatility of our unified approach. To facilitate open research, we will
release our code and models to the community.

   title: We-Math 2.0: A Versatile MathBook System for Incentivizing Visual
  Mathematical Reasoning
   summary: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

   title: VibeVoice Technical Report
   summary: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

   ai_summary: VibeVoice synthesizes long-form multi-speaker speech using next-token diffusion and a highly efficient continuous speech tokenizer, achieving superior performance and fidelity.

   title: WebWatcher: Breaking New Frontier of Vision-Language Deep Research Agent
   summary: Web agents such as Deep Research have demonstrated superhuman cognitive
abilities, capable of solving highly challenging information-seeking problems.
However, most research remains primarily text-centric, overlooking visual
information in the real world. This makes multimodal Deep Research highly
challenging, as such agents require much stronger reasoning abilities in
perception, logic, knowledge, and the use of more sophisticated tools compared
to text-based agents. To address this limitation, we introduce WebWatcher, a
multi-modal Agent for Deep Research equipped with enhanced visual-language
reasoning capabilities. It leverages high-quality synthetic multimodal
trajectories for efficient cold start training, utilizes various tools for deep
reasoning, and further enhances generalization through reinforcement learning.
To better evaluate the capabilities of multimodal agents, we propose
BrowseComp-VL, a benchmark with BrowseComp-style that requires complex
information retrieval involving both visual and textual information.
Experimental results show that WebWatcher significantly outperforms proprietary
baseline, RAG workflow and open-source agents in four challenging VQA
benchmarks, which paves the way for solving complex multimodal
information-seeking tasks.
   id: 2508.05748

   title: Seed Diffusion: A Large-Scale Diffusion Language Model with High-Speed
  Inference
   summary: We present Seed Diffusion Preview, a large-scale language model based on
discrete-state diffusion, offering remarkably fast inference speed. Thanks to
non-sequential, parallel generation, discrete diffusion models provide a
notable speedup to mitigate the inherent latency of token-by-token decoding, as
demonstrated recently (e.g., Mercury Coder, Gemini Diffusion). Seed Diffusion
Preview achieves an inference speed of 2,146 token/s over H20 GPUs while
maintaining competitive performance across a sweep of standard code evaluation
benchmarks, significantly faster than contemporary Mercury and Gemini
Diffusion, establishing new state of the art on the speed-quality Pareto
frontier for code models.

   title: R-Zero: Self-Evolving Reasoning LLM from Zero Data
   summary: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.
   id: 2508.05004
   ai_summary: R-Zero is a self-evolving framework that autonomously generates and learns from its own training data, improving reasoning capabilities in LLMs without human-curated tasks.

   title: Chain-of-Agents: End-to-End Agent Foundation Models via Multi-Agent
  Distillation and Agentic RL
   summary: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

   title: Agent Lightning: Train ANY AI Agents with Reinforcement Learning
   summary: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent
observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent
finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented
generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous
improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent
training and deployment.

   title: Beyond Pass@1: Self-Play with Variational Problem Synthesis Sustains
  RLVR
   summary: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

   title: rStar2-Agent: Agentic Reasoning Technical Report
   summary: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at
https://github.com/microsoft/rStar.
   id: 2508.20722

   title: ReasonRank: Empowering Passage Ranking with Strong Reasoning Ability
   summary: Large Language Model (LLM) based listwise ranking has shown superior
performance in many passage ranking tasks. With the development of Large
Reasoning Models, many studies have demonstrated that step-by-step reasoning
during test-time helps improve listwise ranking performance. However, due to
the scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform
poorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of
reasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we
first propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis
framework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and
applies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A
self-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data
quality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we
further propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a
reinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement.
During the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a
multi-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based
reward. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained reasoning-intensive
reranker ReasonRank outperforms existing baselines significantly and
also achieves much lower latency than pointwise reranker Rank1. Through
further experiments, our ReasonRank has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance 40.6 on the BRIGHT
leaderboard\footnote{https://brightbenchmark.github.io/.} Our codes are
available at https://github.com/8421BCD/ReasonRank.

   title: Seed-Prover: Deep and Broad Reasoning for Automated Theorem Proving
   summary: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
Seed-Prover, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves 78.1% of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine Seed-Geometry, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

   title: Ovis2.5 Technical Report
   summary: We present Ovis2.5, a successor to Ovis2 designed for native-resolution
visual perception and strong multimodal reasoning. Ovis2.5 integrates a
native-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native,
variable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and
preserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense
content like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to
move beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including
self-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional
"thinking mode" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced
accuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive
five-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins
with foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through
large-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning
enhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ
multimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant
end-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and
Ovis2.5-2B. The latter continues the "small model, big performance" philosophy
of Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the
OpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a
substantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving
state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter
range; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size. Beyond aggregate
scores, Ovis2.5 achieves leading results on STEM benchmarks, exhibits strong
capabilities on grounding and video tasks, and achieves open-source SOTA at its
scale for complex chart analysis.

   title: WideSearch: Benchmarking Agentic Broad Info-Seeking
   summary: From professional research to everyday planning, many tasks are bottlenecked
by wide-scale information seeking, which is more repetitive than cognitively
complex. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated
search agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans
from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such
"wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated
due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
WideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these
large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated
questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains,
grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale
atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange
it into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline
ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We
benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including
single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most
systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer
reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple
human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate
that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale
information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and
development in agentic search. Our dataset, evaluation pipeline, and benchmark
results have been publicly released at https://widesearch-seed.github.io/

   title: A Comprehensive Survey of Self-Evolving AI Agents: A New Paradigm
  Bridging Foundation Models and Lifelong Agentic Systems
   summary: Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI
agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing
agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after
deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving
environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution
techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction
data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation
for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation
models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems.
In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for
self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified
conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of
self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components:
System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a
foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this
framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques
that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate
domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as
biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are
tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated
discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for
self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their
effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and
practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents,
laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and
lifelong agentic systems.

   title: SSRL: Self-Search Reinforcement Learning
   summary: We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as
efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL),
thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search
engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs
via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our
results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the
inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,
including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we
introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability
through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively
refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to
external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy
models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL
training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust
sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world
knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL
demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce
hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search
engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs
to support more scalable RL agent training.

   title: Cognitive Kernel-Pro: A Framework for Deep Research Agents and Agent
  Foundation Models Training
   summary: General AI Agents are increasingly recognized as foundational frameworks for
the next generation of artificial intelligence, enabling complex reasoning, web
interaction, coding, and autonomous research capabilities. However, current
agent systems are either closed-source or heavily reliant on a variety of paid
APIs and proprietary tools, limiting accessibility and reproducibility for the
research community. In this work, we present Cognitive Kernel-Pro, a
fully open-source and (to the maximum extent) free multi-module agent framework
designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents.
Within Cognitive Kernel-Pro, we systematically investigate the curation of
high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the
construction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key
domains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel
strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent
robustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving
state-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our
8B-parameter open-source model surpasses previous leading systems such as
WebDancer and WebSailor, establishing a new performance standard for
accessible, high-capability AI agents. Code is available at

   title: Deep Think with Confidence
   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting.
However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think
with Confidence (DeepConf), a simple yet powerful method that enhances both
reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full
parallel thinking.

   title: Pref-GRPO: Pairwise Preference Reward-based GRPO for Stable
  Text-to-Image Reinforcement Learning
   summary: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

   title: Beyond Transcription: Mechanistic Interpretability in ASR
   summary: Interpretability methods have recently gained significant attention,
particularly in the context of large language models, enabling insights into
linguistic representations, error detection, and model behaviors such as
hallucinations and repetitions. However, these techniques remain underexplored
in automatic speech recognition (ASR), despite their potential to advance both
the performance and interpretability of ASR systems. In this work, we adapt and
systematically apply established interpretability methods such as logit lens,
linear probing, and activation patching, to examine how acoustic and semantic
information evolves across layers in ASR systems. Our experiments reveal
previously unknown internal dynamics, including specific encoder-decoder
interactions responsible for repetition hallucinations and semantic biases
encoded deep within acoustic representations. These insights demonstrate the
benefits of extending and applying interpretability techniques to speech
recognition, opening promising directions for future research on improving
model transparency and robustness.

   title: Efficient Agents: Building Effective Agents While Reducing Cost
   summary: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from 0.398 to 0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility
and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

   title: DuPO: Enabling Reliable LLM Self-Verification via Dual Preference
  Optimization
   summary: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that
generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses
two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s
reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and
traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,
translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,
and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.
   id: 2508.14460
   ai_summary: DuPO is a dual learning framework that generates annotation-free feedback using a generalized duality, enhancing performance across various tasks without relying on costly labels.

   title: Self-Rewarding Vision-Language Model via Reasoning Decomposition
   summary: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucinations, saying
things that are not actually in the image, and language shortcuts, where they
skip the visual part and just rely on text priors. These issues arise because
most post-training methods for VLMs rely on simple verifiable answer matching
and supervise only final outputs, leaving intermediate visual reasoning without
explicit guidance. As a result, VLMs receive sparse visual signals and often
learn to prioritize language-based reasoning over visual perception. To
mitigate this, some existing methods add visual supervision using human
annotations or distilled labels from external large models. However, human
annotations are labor-intensive and costly, and because external signals cannot
adapt to the evolving policy, they cause distributional shifts that can lead to
reward hacking. In this paper, we introduce Vision-SR1, a self-rewarding method
that improves visual reasoning without relying on external visual supervisions
via reinforcement learning. Vision-SR1 decomposes VLM reasoning into two
stages: visual perception and language reasoning. The model is first prompted
to produce self-contained visual perceptions that are sufficient to answer the
question without referring back the input image. To validate this
self-containment, the same VLM model is then re-prompted to perform language
reasoning using only the generated perception as input to compute reward. This
self-reward is combined with supervision on final outputs, providing a balanced
training signal that strengthens both visual perception and language reasoning.
Our experiments demonstrate that Vision-SR1 improves visual reasoning,
mitigates visual hallucinations, and reduces reliance on language shortcuts
across diverse vision-language tasks.
   id: 2508.19652
   ai_summary: Vision-SR1 uses reinforcement learning to enhance visual reasoning in vision-language models by decomposing the process into visual perception and language reasoning stages, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations.

   title: Thyme: Think Beyond Images
   summary: Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,
recent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the
reasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning
tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently
offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform
diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning
capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this
direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for
enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by
autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and
computational operations via executable code. This approach not only
facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,
rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,
all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these
operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:
an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,
followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually
collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the
learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies
distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning
exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental
analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20
benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,
particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning
tasks.
   id: 2508.11630
   ai_summary: Thyme, a novel paradigm, enables MLLMs to autonomously perform image manipulations and computations, enhancing performance in perception and reasoning tasks through a two-stage training strategy and GRPO-ATS algorithm.

   title: TreePO: Bridging the Gap of Policy Optimization and Efficacy and
  Inference Efficiency with Heuristic Tree-based Modeling
   summary: Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement
learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems,
but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of
diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a
self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a
tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and
fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant
additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and
pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update
compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key
contributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates
the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along
with an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage
estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization.
and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic
divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain
of TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours
from 22\% up to 43\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile
showing up to 40\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\% at token-level
sampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of
inference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based
post-training with fewer samples and less compute. Home page locates at

   title: ComoRAG: A Cognitive-Inspired Memory-Organized RAG for Stateful Long
  Narrative Reasoning
   summary: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging
domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving
relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning
over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches
remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall
short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often
overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within
long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle
that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving
interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,
analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the
brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes
iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.
In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,
then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory
pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query
resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+
tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative
gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals
that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global
comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for
retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning. Our code
is publicly released at https://github.com/EternityJune25/ComoRAG
   id: 2508.10419
   ai_summary: ComoRAG, an iterative retrieval-based approach, enhances long-context narrative comprehension by dynamically updating memory and generating probing queries, outperforming traditional RAG methods.

   title: Genie Envisioner: A Unified World Foundation Platform for Robotic
  Manipulation
   summary: We introduce Genie Envisioner (GE), a unified world foundation platform for
robotic manipulation that integrates policy learning, evaluation, and
simulation within a single video-generative framework. At its core, GE-Base is
a large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the
spatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in
a structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent
representations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight,
flow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference
across diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable
evaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural
simulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development.
The platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite
measuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action
alignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable
and practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied
intelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly.

   title: FutureX: An Advanced Live Benchmark for LLM Agents in Future Prediction
   summary: Future prediction is a complex task for LLM agents, requiring a high level of
analytical thinking, information gathering, contextual understanding, and
decision-making under uncertainty. Agents must not only gather and interpret
vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources,
weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as
human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its
importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future
prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and
retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce
FutureX, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically
designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the
largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting
real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated
pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent
models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of
external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source
Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive
reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide
in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in
future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the
temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free
evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of
performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and
predictive thinking.

   title: PRELUDE: A Benchmark Designed to Require Global Comprehension and
  Reasoning over Long Contexts
   summary: We introduce PRELUDE, a benchmark for evaluating long-context understanding
through the task of determining whether a character's prequel story is
consistent with the canonical narrative of the original book. Our task poses a
stronger demand for global comprehension and deep reasoning than existing
benchmarks -- as the prequels are not part of the original story, assessing
their plausibility typically requires searching and integrating information
that is only indirectly related. Empirically, 88% of instances require evidence
from multiple parts of the narrative. Experimental results highlight the
challenge of our task: in-context learning, RAG and in-domain training with
state-of-the-art LLMs, and commercial DeepResearch services, lag behind humans
by >15%. A further human study reveals that models often produce correct
answers with flawed reasoning, leading to an over 30% gap in reasoning accuracy
compared to humans. These findings underscore the substantial room for
improvement in long-context understanding and reasoning.

   ai_summary: A benchmark called PRELUDE evaluates long-context understanding by assessing the consistency of prequel stories with original books, revealing significant challenges for models compared to humans.

   title: MeshCoder: LLM-Powered Structured Mesh Code Generation from Point Clouds
   summary: Reconstructing 3D objects into editable programs is pivotal for applications
like reverse engineering and shape editing. However, existing methods often
rely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets,
restricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To
address these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that
reconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python
scripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs
capable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we
construct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each
object is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a
multimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into
executable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior
performance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates
intuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code
modifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these
contributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for
programmatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding.

   title: Story2Board: A Training-Free Approach for Expressive Storyboard
  Generation
   summary: We present Story2Board, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard
generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject
identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial
composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we
introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components:
Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across
panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual
features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these
mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning,
enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet
consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf
language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.
To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain
narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded
storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene
Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.
Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that
Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging
storyboards than existing baselines.

   ai_summary: Story2Board generates expressive storyboards from natural language using a consistency framework that enhances coherence and diversity without fine-tuning.

   title: DeepPHY: Benchmarking Agentic VLMs on Physical Reasoning
   summary: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs
struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive
control.

   title: MCP-Bench: Benchmarking Tool-Using LLM Agents with Complex Real-World
  Tasks via MCP Servers
   summary: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.
Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in MCP-Bench. Code

   title: 4DNeX: Feed-Forward 4D Generative Modeling Made Easy
   summary: We present 4DNeX, the first feed-forward framework for generating 4D (i.e.,
dynamic 3D) scene representations from a single image. In contrast to existing
methods that rely on computationally intensive optimization or require
multi-frame video inputs, 4DNeX enables efficient, end-to-end image-to-4D
generation by fine-tuning a pretrained video diffusion model. Specifically, 1)
to alleviate the scarcity of 4D data, we construct 4DNeX-10M, a large-scale
dataset with high-quality 4D annotations generated using advanced
reconstruction approaches. 2) we introduce a unified 6D video representation
that jointly models RGB and XYZ sequences, facilitating structured learning of
both appearance and geometry. 3) we propose a set of simple yet effective
adaptation strategies to repurpose pretrained video diffusion models for 4D
modeling. 4DNeX produces high-quality dynamic point clouds that enable
novel-view video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4DNeX
outperforms existing 4D generation methods in efficiency and generalizability,
offering a scalable solution for image-to-4D modeling and laying the foundation
for generative 4D world models that simulate dynamic scene evolution.

   title: Skywork UniPic: Unified Autoregressive Modeling for Visual Understanding
  and Generation
   summary: We introduce Skywork UniPic, a 1.5 billion-parameter autoregressive model
that unifies image understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing
within a single architecture-eliminating the need for task-specific adapters or
inter-module connectors-and demonstrate that compact multimodal systems can
achieve state-of-the-art performance on commodity hardware. Skywork UniPic
achieves a GenEval score of 0.86, surpassing most existing unified models; sets
a new DPG-Bench complex-generation record of 85.5; attains 5.83 on
GEditBench-EN and 3.49 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing; and generates 1024 x
1024 images with under 15 GB of GPU memory (e.g., RTX 4090). (1) a decoupled
encoding strategy that leverages a masked autoregressive encoder for synthesis
and a SigLIP2 encoder for understanding, all feeding a shared autoregressive
decoder; (2) a progressive, resolution-aware training schedule scaling from 256
x 256 to 1024 x 1024 while dynamically unfreezing parameters to balance
capacity and stability; and (3) meticulously curated, 100 million-scale
datasets augmented with task-specific reward models to refine generation and
editing objectives. By demonstrating that high-fidelity multimodal integration
need not incur prohibitive resource demands, Skywork UniPic establishes a
practical paradigm for deployable, high-fidelity multimodal AI. Code and

   title: Beyond Fixed: Variable-Length Denoising for Diffusion Large Language
  Models
   summary: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful
alternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering
efficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the
practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural
constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static
length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths
cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant
computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While
the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses
internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given
task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce
DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive
Length Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two
phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial
length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided
by a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL
dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation
regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully
developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves
performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned
fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency
by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length
constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap
with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient
and capable generation.

   title: BeyondWeb: Lessons from Scaling Synthetic Data for Trillion-scale
  Pretraining
   summary: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that
simply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting a
data wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged
as a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this,
the factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this
work, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that
produces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly
extends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming
state-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and
Nemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1
percentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of
14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web
data and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for
180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token
budget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on
synthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to
rephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.
Overall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating
high-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly
optimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and
practical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements,
potentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative
improvements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb.

   title: LongSplat: Robust Unposed 3D Gaussian Splatting for Casual Long Videos
   summary: LongSplat addresses critical challenges in novel view synthesis (NVS) from
casually captured long videos characterized by irregular camera motion, unknown
camera poses, and expansive scenes. Current methods often suffer from pose
drift, inaccurate geometry initialization, and severe memory limitations. To
address these issues, we introduce LongSplat, a robust unposed 3D Gaussian
Splatting framework featuring: (1) Incremental Joint Optimization that
concurrently optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussians to avoid local minima and
ensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging
learned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that
converts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LongSplat achieves
state-of-the-art results, substantially improving rendering quality, pose
accuracy, and computational efficiency compared to prior approaches. Project

   title: From Scores to Skills: A Cognitive Diagnosis Framework for Evaluating
  Financial Large Language Models
   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for financial applications,
yet their suitability for this high-stakes domain remains largely unproven due
to inadequacies in existing benchmarks. Existing benchmarks solely rely on
score-level evaluation, summarizing performance with a single score that
obscures the nuanced understanding of what models truly know and their precise
limitations. They also rely on datasets that cover only a narrow subset of
financial concepts, while overlooking other essentials for real-world
applications. To address these gaps, we introduce FinCDM, the first cognitive
diagnosis evaluation framework tailored for financial LLMs, enabling the
evaluation of LLMs at the knowledge-skill level, identifying what financial
skills and knowledge they have or lack based on their response patterns across
skill-tagged tasks, rather than a single aggregated number. We construct
CPA-QKA, the first cognitively informed financial evaluation dataset derived
from the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) examination, with comprehensive
coverage of real-world accounting and financial skills. It is rigorously
annotated by domain experts, who author, validate, and annotate questions with
high inter-annotator agreement and fine-grained knowledge labels. Our extensive
experiments on 30 proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs show that
FinCDM reveals hidden knowledge gaps, identifies under-tested areas such as tax
and regulatory reasoning overlooked by traditional benchmarks, and uncovers
behavioral clusters among models. FinCDM introduces a new paradigm for
financial LLM evaluation by enabling interpretable, skill-aware diagnosis that
supports more trustworthy and targeted model development, and all datasets and
evaluation scripts will be publicly released to support further research.

   title: SitEmb-v1.5: Improved Context-Aware Dense Retrieval for Semantic
  Association and Long Story Comprehension
   summary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over long documents typically involves
splitting the text into smaller chunks, which serve as the basic units for
retrieval. However, due to dependencies across the original document,
contextual information is often essential for accurately interpreting each
chunk. To address this, prior work has explored encoding longer context windows
to produce embeddings for longer chunks. Despite these efforts, gains in
retrieval and downstream tasks remain limited. This is because (1) longer
chunks strain the capacity of embedding models due to the increased amount of
information they must encode, and (2) many real-world applications still
require returning localized evidence due to constraints on model or human
bandwidth.
  We propose an alternative approach to this challenge by representing short
chunks in a way that is conditioned on a broader context window to enhance
retrieval performance -- i.e., situating a chunk's meaning within its context.
We further show that existing embedding models are not well-equipped to encode
such situated context effectively, and thus introduce a new training paradigm
and develop the situated embedding models (SitEmb). To evaluate our method, we
curate a book-plot retrieval dataset specifically designed to assess situated
retrieval capabilities. On this benchmark, our SitEmb-v1 model based on BGE-M3
substantially outperforms state-of-the-art embedding models, including several
with up to 7-8B parameters, with only 1B parameters. Our 8B SitEmb-v1.5 model
further improves performance by over 10% and shows strong results across
different languages and several downstream applications.

   title: Seeing, Listening, Remembering, and Reasoning: A Multimodal Agent with
  Long-Term Memory
   summary: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with
long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and
auditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic
memory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world
knowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal
format, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment.
Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative
reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the
task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal
agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.
M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's
perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse
scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test
key capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding,
general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results
show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the
strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o,
achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web
and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances the multimodal agents toward
more human-like long-term memory and provides insights into their practical
design. Model, code and data are available at

   title: Sharing is Caring: Efficient LM Post-Training with Collective RL
  Experience Sharing
   summary: Post-training language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) can
enhance their complex reasoning capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as
demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero. However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs
requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces
non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability)
alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training
algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute
nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts
with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model
homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired.
As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL
post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By
sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to
propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show
SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.
We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes
contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse
hardware and models during an open-source demo.

   ai_summary: Swarm sAmpling Policy Optimization (SAPO) is a decentralized and asynchronous RL algorithm that enhances post-training language models without supervised fine-tuning, achieving significant reward gains and scalability across diverse hardware.

   title: A.S.E: A Repository-Level Benchmark for Evaluating Security in
  AI-Generated Code
   summary: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software
engineering necessitates rigorous security evaluation of their generated code.
However, existing benchmarks often lack relevance to real-world AI programming
scenarios, making them inadequate for assessing the practical security risks
associated with AI-generated code in production environments. To address this
gap, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security Evaluation), a
repository-level evaluation benchmark designed to closely mirror real-world AI
programming tasks, offering a comprehensive and reliable framework for
assessing the security of AI-generated code. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on
A.S.E reveals several key findings. In particular, current LLMs still struggle
with secure coding. The complexity in repository-level scenarios presents
challenges for LLMs that typically perform well on snippet-level tasks.
Morever, a larger reasoning budget does not necessarily lead to better code
generation. These observations offer valuable insights into the current state
of AI code generation, assisting developers in selecting the most appropriate
models for practical tasks, while laying the foundation for refining LLMs to
generate secure and efficient code in real-world applications.

   title: VLA-Adapter: An Effective Paradigm for Tiny-Scale Vision-Language-Action
  Model
   summary: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between
perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language
Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance,
it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to
effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We
introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA
models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first
systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present
key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and
action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module
with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into
the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only
a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate
that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also
offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the
proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a
powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly
lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model. Project page:

   title: The Landscape of Agentic Reinforcement Learning for LLMs: A Survey
   summary: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.

   title: Drivel-ology: Challenging LLMs with Interpreting Nonsense with Depth
   summary: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.
   id: 2509.03867
   ai_summary: LLMs struggle with understanding the nuanced, context-dependent meanings of Drivelological text, which appears nonsensical but contains deeper semantic layers.

   title: Why Language Models Hallucinate
   summary: Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes
guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of
admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art
systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because
the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging
uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the
modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they
originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements
cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language
models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that
hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language
models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain
improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses
can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the
scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards,
rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may
steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.
   id: 2509.04664
   ai_summary: Language models produce incorrect statements due to training and evaluation procedures that reward guessing over acknowledging uncertainty, leading to a need for socio-technical changes in benchmark scoring.

   title: A Survey of Reinforcement Learning for Large Reasoning Models
   summary: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for
reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success
in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing
complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has
emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the
rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces
foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in
algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely
to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore
strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence
(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for
reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including
foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream
applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly
evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for
broader reasoning models. Github:

   title: LongLive: Real-time Interactive Long Video Generation
   summary: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.
   id: 2509.22622

   title: Reverse-Engineered Reasoning for Open-Ended Generation
   summary: While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in
verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative
generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for
instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction
distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear
reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is
prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a
new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a
reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works
``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,
step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this
scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a
large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.
Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong
open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at
times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

   title: Qwen3-Omni Technical Report
   summary: We present Qwen3-Omni, a single multimodal model that, for the first time,
maintains state-of-the-art performance across text, image, audio, and video
without any degradation relative to single-modal counterparts. Qwen3-Omni
matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen
series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual
benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source SOTA on 32 benchmarks and overall
SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro,
Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe. Qwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker-Talker MoE
architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio,
and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text
interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages, and speech
generation in 10 languages. To reduce first-packet latency in streaming
synthesis, Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a
multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these
codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a
lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In
cold-start settings, Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet
latency of 234 ms. To further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a
Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the
research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we
fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which
produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs.
Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking, and
Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0

   title: A Survey of Scientific Large Language Models: From Data Foundations to
  Agent Frontiers
   summary: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

   title: MinerU2.5: A Decoupled Vision-Language Model for Efficient
  High-Resolution Document Parsing
   summary: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

   title: EPO: Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization for LLM Agents
  Reinforcement Learning
   summary: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where
completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode,
presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a
critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

   title: Baseer: A Vision-Language Model for Arabic Document-to-Markdown OCR
   summary: Arabic document OCR remains a challenging task due to the language's cursive
script, diverse fonts, diacritics, and right-to-left orientation. While modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced document understanding
for high-resource languages, their performance on Arabic remains limited. In
this work, we introduce Baseer, a vision-language model fine- tuned
specifically for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging a large-scale dataset
combining synthetic and real-world documents, Baseer is trained using a
decoder-only fine-tuning strategy to adapt a pre-trained MLLM while preserving
general visual features. We also present Misraj-DocOCR, a high-quality,
expert-verified benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of Arabic OCR
systems. Our experiments show that Baseer significantly outperforms existing
open-source and commercial solutions, achieving a WER of 0.25 and establishing
a new state-of-the-art in the domain of Arabic document OCR. Our results
highlight the benefits of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs
and establish a strong baseline for high-accuracy OCR on morphologically rich
languages like Arabic.

   title: HuMo: Human-Centric Video Generation via Collaborative Multi-Modal
  Conditioning
   summary: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

   title: RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase
  Generation
   summary: Large language models excel at function- and file-level code generation, yet
generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge.
This process demands coherent and reliable planning across proposal- and
implementation-level stages, while natural language, due to its ambiguity and
verbosity, is ill-suited for faithfully representing complex software
structures. To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG),
a persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level
planning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions
in one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit
blueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation.
Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository
generation from scratch. It operates in three stages: proposal-level planning
and implementation-level refinement to construct the graph, followed by
graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate this setting, we
construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks.
On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC, roughly
3.9times the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64times other
baselines. It attains 81.5% functional coverage and a 69.7% pass rate,
exceeding Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 percentage points, respectively. Further
analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables progressively more
sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and enhances LLM
understanding of repositories, thereby accelerating agent localization.
   id: 2509.16198

   title: UI-TARS-2 Technical Report: Advancing GUI Agent with Multi-Turn
  Reinforcement Learning
   summary: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization
to real-world interactive scenarios.

   title: VCRL: Variance-based Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for Large
  Language Models
   summary: Policy-based reinforcement learning currently plays an important role in
improving LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based
reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly
consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels,
which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning
tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the
rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current
sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower
variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based
on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance
of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models

   title: SLA: Beyond Sparsity in Diffusion Transformers via Fine-Tunable
  Sparse-Linear Attention
   summary: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation,
attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the
quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two
parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining
weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse
acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based
on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable
attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion
models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and
negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)
attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these
computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward
passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x
reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration
without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention
computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,
outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU
kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a
2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

   title: Quantile Advantage Estimation for Entropy-Safe Reasoning
   summary: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM
reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and
{entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in
value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes
negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile
Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile
baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <=
1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it
targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove
{two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy
change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal
modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K,
roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1
gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results
identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the
primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

   title: Scaling Agents via Continual Pre-training
   summary: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of
autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation
models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source
implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic
foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn
diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby
creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to
propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the
deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational
models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named
AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably
39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

   title: FlowRL: Matching Reward Distributions for LLM Reasoning
   summary: We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing
instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement
learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods
(\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while
neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In
contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution
using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL
divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this
idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration
and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and
code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of
10.0% over GRPO and 5.1% over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs
consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward
distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse
reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.

   title: ScaleCUA: Scaling Open-Source Computer Use Agents with Cross-Platform
  Data
   summary: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled computer use agents (CUAs) that
operate GUIs autonomously, showing great potential, yet progress is limited by
the lack of large-scale, open-source computer use data and foundation models.
In this work, we introduce ScaleCUA, a step toward scaling open-source CUAs. It
offers a large-scale dataset spanning 6 operating systems and 3 task domains,
built via a closed-loop pipeline uniting automated agents with human experts.
Trained on this scaled-up data, ScaleCUA can operate seamlessly across
platforms. Specifically, it delivers strong gains over baselines (+26.6 on
WebArena-Lite-v2, +10.7 on ScreenSpot-Pro) and sets new state-of-the-art
results (94.4% on MMBench-GUI L1-Hard, 60.6% on OSWorld-G, 47.4% on
WebArena-Lite-v2). These findings underscore the power of data-driven scaling
for general-purpose computer use agents. We will release data, models, and code
to advance future research: https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ScaleCUA.

   title: R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs
  via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning
   summary: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

   title: OmniWorld: A Multi-Domain and Multi-Modal Dataset for 4D World Modeling
   summary: The field of 4D world modeling - aiming to jointly capture spatial geometry
and temporal dynamics - has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years,
driven by advances in large-scale generative models and multimodal learning.
However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally
constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and
benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and
spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric
reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To
address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain,
multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld
consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public
datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets,
OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more
realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a
challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning
existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains
across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating
OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision
OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D
world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the
physical world.

   title: WebWeaver: Structuring Web-Scale Evidence with Dynamic Outlines for
  Open-Ended Deep Research
   summary: This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where
AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative
methodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are
crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.

   title: MMR1: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning with Variance-Aware Sampling and
  Open Resources
   summary: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at
https://github.com/LengSicong/MMR1.

   title: LIMI: Less is More for Agency
   summary: We define Agency as the emergent capacity of AI systems to function as
autonomous agents actively discovering problems, formulating hypotheses, and
executing solutions through self-directed engagement with environments and
tools. This fundamental capability marks the dawn of the Age of AI Agency,
driven by a critical industry shift: the urgent need for AI systems that don't
just think, but work. While current AI excels at reasoning and generating
responses, industries demand autonomous agents that can execute tasks, operate
tools, and drive real-world outcomes. As agentic intelligence becomes the
defining characteristic separating cognitive systems from productive workers,
efficiently cultivating machine autonomy becomes paramount. Current approaches
assume that more data yields better agency, following traditional scaling laws
from language modeling. We fundamentally challenge this paradigm. LIMI (Less Is
More for Intelligent Agency) demonstrates that agency follows radically
different development principles. Through strategic focus on collaborative
software development and scientific research workflows, we show that
sophisticated agentic intelligence can emerge from minimal but strategically
curated demonstrations of autonomous behavior. Using only 78 carefully designed
training samples, LIMI achieves 73.5% on comprehensive agency benchmarks,
dramatically outperforming state-of-the-art models: Kimi-K2-Instruct (24.1%),
DeepSeek-V3.1 (11.9%), Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct (27.5%), and GLM-4.5 (45.1%).
Most strikingly, LIMI demonstrates 53.7% improvement over models trained on
10,000 samples-achieving superior agentic intelligence with 128 times fewer
samples. Our findings establish the Agency Efficiency Principle: machine
autonomy emerges not from data abundance but from strategic curation of
high-quality agentic demonstrations.

   title: SciReasoner: Laying the Scientific Reasoning Ground Across Disciplines
   summary: We present a scientific reasoning foundation model that aligns natural
language with heterogeneous scientific representations. The model is pretrained
on a 206B-token corpus spanning scientific text, pure sequences, and
sequence-text pairs, then aligned via SFT on 40M instructions, annealed
cold-start bootstrapping to elicit long-form chain-of-thought, and
reinforcement learning with task-specific reward shaping, which instills
deliberate scientific reasoning. It supports four capability families, covering
up to 103 tasks across workflows: (i) faithful translation between text and
scientific formats, (ii) text/knowledge extraction, (iii) property prediction,
(iv) property classification, (v) unconditional and conditional sequence
generation and design. Compared with specialist systems, our approach broadens
instruction coverage, improves cross-domain generalization, and enhances
fidelity. We detail data curation and training and show that cross-discipline
learning strengthens transfer and downstream reliability. The model, instruct
tuning datasets and the evaluation code are open-sourced at

   title: Parallel-R1: Towards Parallel Thinking via Reinforcement Learning
   summary: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose Parallel-R1, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a mid-training exploration scaffold, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

   title: Video models are zero-shot learners and reasoners
   summary: The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified,
generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple
primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the
same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be
on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs
developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can
solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting
objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties,
recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities
to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of
visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot
capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified,
generalist vision foundation models.

   title: From Editor to Dense Geometry Estimator
   summary: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce FE2E, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100times data.

   title: Tree Search for LLM Agent Reinforcement Learning
   summary: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.
   id: 2509.21240

   title: WebSailor-V2: Bridging the Chasm to Proprietary Agents via Synthetic
  Data and Scalable Reinforcement Learning
   summary: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

   title: Hala Technical Report: Building Arabic-Centric Instruction & Translation
  Models at Scale
   summary: We present Hala, a family of Arabic-centric instruction and translation
models built with our translate-and-tune pipeline. We first compress a strong
ARleftrightarrowEN teacher to FP8 (yielding sim2times higher
throughput with no quality loss) and use it to create high-fidelity bilingual
supervision. A lightweight language model LFM2-1.2B is then fine-tuned on this
data and used to translate high-quality English instruction sets into Arabic,
producing a million-scale corpus tailored to instruction following. We train
Hala models at 350M, 700M, 1.2B, and 9B parameters, and apply slerp merging to
balance Arabic specialization with base-model strengths. On Arabic-centric
benchmarks, Hala achieves state-of-the-art results within both the "nano"
(leq2B) and "small" (7-9B) categories, outperforming their bases. We release
models, data, evaluation, and recipes to accelerate research in Arabic NLP.

   title: LLaVA-Critic-R1: Your Critic Model is Secretly a Strong Policy Model
   summary: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.
   id: 2509.00676
   ai_summary: Reinforcement learning on preference-labeled critic datasets enhances a generative model's performance, creating a unified multimodal system that excels in both evaluation and generation.

   title: Visual Representation Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models
   summary: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

   title: SimpleTIR: End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn
  Tool-Integrated Reasoning
   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning
capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios
using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and
performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by
a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation
of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing
catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To
address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that
stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter
out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code
block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the
policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude
gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math
reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only
baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.
Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR
encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns,
such as self-correction and cross-validation.

   title: Seedream 4.0: Toward Next-generation Multimodal Image Generation
   summary: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on

   title: ReSum: Unlocking Long-Horizon Search Intelligence via Context
  Summarization
   summary: Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in
paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined
relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly
exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite
exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing
interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of
prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,
we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and
advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned
reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three
benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of
4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO
training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a
ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on
BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web
agents.

   title: SimpleVLA-RL: Scaling VLA Training via Reinforcement Learning
   summary: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by
large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two
fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale
human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited
generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can
dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural
question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action
planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL
framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce
VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment
rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,
SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms pi_0
on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.
SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust
generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.
Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,
wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in
the previous training process. Github: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/SimpleVLA-RL

   title: WebExplorer: Explore and Evolve for Training Long-Horizon Web Agents
   summary: The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly shifted toward
agentic applications, where web browsing capabilities are fundamental for
retrieving information from diverse online sources. However, existing
open-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities
on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify
that the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information
seeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic
data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative,
long-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer
pairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By
leveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced
web agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100
tool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse
information-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art
performance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able
to effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving
higher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best
performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES.
Beyond these information-seeking tasks, our model also achieves strong
generalization on the HLE benchmark even though it is only trained on
knowledge-intensive QA data. These results highlight our approach as a
practical path toward long-horizon web agents.

   title: EmbodiedOneVision: Interleaved Vision-Text-Action Pretraining for
  General Robot Control
   summary: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical
interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied
intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are
co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable
progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve
human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work,
introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is
a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in
multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved
vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key
pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs
indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive,
high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains
over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action
comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive
decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot
action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for
open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of
long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This
paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of
EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for
developing advanced embodied foundation models.

   title: VerlTool: Towards Holistic Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool Use
   summary: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2times speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

   title: Towards a Unified View of Large Language Model Post-Training
   summary: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

   title: Droplet3D: Commonsense Priors from Videos Facilitate 3D Generation
   summary: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

   title: RewardDance: Reward Scaling in Visual Generation
   summary: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.
   id: 2509.08826
   ai_summary: RewardDance is a scalable reward modeling framework that aligns with VLM architectures, enabling effective scaling of RMs and resolving reward hacking issues in generation models.

   title: Towards General Agentic Intelligence via Environment Scaling
   summary: Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language
Models in practical, real-world applications. Diverse real-world APIs demand
precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop
these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of
function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in
which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step
towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central
challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how
to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through
interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable
framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are
fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling
scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first
endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them
for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,
tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,
AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.

   title: Language Models Can Learn from Verbal Feedback Without Scalar Rewards
   summary: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods
typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of
their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal
feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image
generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the
feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback
pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum
likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping
stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh
feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as
conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more
expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.
   id: 2509.22638
   ai_summary: Feedback-conditional policy (FCP) enables LLMs to learn from verbal feedback by treating it as a conditioning signal, improving expressiveness over scalar rewards.

   title: Open Data Synthesis For Deep Research
   summary: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple
factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions
into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence
from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers
as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are
fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP
formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA)
fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often
introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural
depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for
synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to
recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring
intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into
natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also
enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set,
and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that
models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a
challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass
much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash),
while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro).
By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels,
InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound
reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and
datasets in https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek{this repository}.
   id: 2509.00375
   ai_summary: InfoSeek is a scalable framework for generating complex Deep Research tasks by synthesizing hierarchical constraint satisfaction problems, enabling models to outperform larger baselines on challenging benchmarks.

   title: The Dragon Hatchling: The Missing Link between the Transformer and
  Models of the Brain
   summary: The relationship between computing systems and the brain has served as
motivation for pioneering theoreticians since John von Neumann and Alan Turing.
Uniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful
properties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for
Machine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.
  We introduce `Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a new Large Language Model
architecture based on a scale-free biologically inspired network of \n
locally-interacting neuron particles. BDH couples strong theoretical
foundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like
performance.
  BDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space
sequence learning architecture. In addition to being a graph model, BDH admits
a GPU-friendly formulation. It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws:
empirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at
the same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.
  BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during
inference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using
spiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses
strengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept
while processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a
graph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model
is biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human
neurons could use to achieve speech.
  BDH is designed for interpretability. Activation vectors of BDH are sparse
and positive. We demonstrate monosemanticity in BDH on language tasks.
Interpretability of state, which goes beyond interpretability of neurons and
model parameters, is an inherent feature of the BDH architecture.

   title: Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks
   summary: Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) is a novel approach using two small neural
networks recursing at different frequencies. This biologically inspired method
beats Large Language models (LLMs) on hard puzzle tasks such as Sudoku, Maze,
and ARC-AGI while trained with small models (27M parameters) on small data
(around 1000 examples). HRM holds great promise for solving hard problems with
small networks, but it is not yet well understood and may be suboptimal. We
propose Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), a much simpler recursive reasoning approach
that achieves significantly higher generalization than HRM, while using a
single tiny network with only 2 layers. With only 7M parameters, TRM obtains
45% test-accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2, higher than most LLMs
(e.g., Deepseek R1, o3-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with less than 0.01% of the
parameters.
   id: 2510.04871
   ai_summary: Tiny Recursive Model (TRM) achieves high generalization on complex puzzle tasks using a small, two-layer network with minimal parameters, outperforming larger language models.

   title: Agent Learning via Early Experience
   summary: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

   title: Scaling Latent Reasoning via Looped Language Models
   summary: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.
Our model could be found in: http://ouro-llm.github.io.

   title: Concerto: Joint 2D-3D Self-Supervised Learning Emerges Spatial
  Representations
   summary: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,
such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by
this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

   title: QeRL: Beyond Efficiency -- Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning
  for LLMs
   summary: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

   title: MCPMark: A Benchmark for Stress-Testing Realistic and Comprehensive MCP
  Use
   summary: MCP standardizes how LLMs interact with external systems, forming the
foundation for general agents. However, existing MCP benchmarks remain narrow
in scope: they focus on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction
depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows.
To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate MCP
use in a more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of 127
high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents.
Each task begins with a curated initial state and includes a programmatic
script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse
interactions with the environment, involving a broad range of create, read,
update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
cutting-edge LLMs using a minimal agent framework that operates in a
tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model,
gpt-5-medium, reaches only 52.56\% pass@1 and 33.86\% pass^4, while other
widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below
30\% pass@1 and 15\% pass^4. On average, LLMs require 16.2 execution
turns and 17.4 tool calls per task, significantly surpassing those in
previous MCP benchmarks and highlighting the stress-testing nature of MCPMark.

   ai_summary: MCPMark is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MCP use in real-world workflows, featuring diverse tasks that require richer interactions with the environment, and reveals that current LLMs perform poorly on these tasks.

   title: Diffusion Transformers with Representation Autoencoders
   summary: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

   title: A Theoretical Study on Bridging Internal Probability and
  Self-Consistency for LLM Reasoning
   summary: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach
within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance
reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during
inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations
remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework
for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the
perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two
dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key
limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while
perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the
estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a
hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key
components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity
Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting
the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while
preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating
low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong
potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning
performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence
reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are

   title: Spatial Forcing: Implicit Spatial Representation Alignment for
  Vision-language-action Model
   summary: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently shown strong potential in
enabling robots to follow language instructions and execute precise actions.
However, most VLAs are built upon vision-language models pretrained solely on
2D data, which lack accurate spatial awareness and hinder their ability to
operate in the 3D physical world. Existing solutions attempt to incorporate
explicit 3D sensor inputs such as depth maps or point clouds, but these
approaches face challenges due to sensor noise, hardware heterogeneity, and
incomplete depth coverage in existing datasets. Alternative methods that
estimate 3D cues from 2D images also suffer from the limited performance of
depth estimators.We propose Spatial Forcing (SF), a simple yet effective
alignment strategy that implicitly forces VLA models to develop spatial
comprehension capabilities without relying on explicit 3D inputs or depth
estimators. SF aligns intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric
representations produced by pretrained 3D foundation models. By enforcing
alignment at intermediate layers, SF guides VLAs to encode richer spatial
representations that enhance action precision.Extensive experiments in
simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that SF achieves
state-of-the-art results, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs. SF further
accelerates training by up to 3.8x and improves data efficiency across diverse
robotic tasks. Project page is at https://spatial-forcing.github.io/

   title: D2E: Scaling Vision-Action Pretraining on Desktop Data for Transfer to
  Embodied AI
   summary: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at
https://worv-ai.github.io/d2e/

   title: DeepSearch: Overcome the Bottleneck of Reinforcement Learning with
  Verifiable Rewards via Monte Carlo Tree Search
   summary: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

   title: Vision-Zero: Scalable VLM Self-Improvement via Strategic Gamified
  Self-Play
   summary: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at
https://github.com/wangqinsi1/Vision-Zero.
   id: 2509.25541

   title: Agentic Context Engineering: Evolving Contexts for Self-Improving
  Language Models
   summary: Large language model (LLM) applications such as agents and domain-specific
reasoning increasingly rely on context adaptation -- modifying inputs with
instructions, strategies, or evidence, rather than weight updates. Prior
approaches improve usability but often suffer from brevity bias, which drops
domain insights for concise summaries, and from context collapse, where
iterative rewriting erodes details over time. Building on the adaptive memory
introduced by Dynamic Cheatsheet, we introduce ACE (Agentic Context
Engineering), a framework that treats contexts as evolving playbooks that
accumulate, refine, and organize strategies through a modular process of
generation, reflection, and curation. ACE prevents collapse with structured,
incremental updates that preserve detailed knowledge and scale with
long-context models. Across agent and domain-specific benchmarks, ACE optimizes
contexts both offline (e.g., system prompts) and online (e.g., agent memory),
consistently outperforming strong baselines: +10.6% on agents and +8.6% on
finance, while significantly reducing adaptation latency and rollout cost.
Notably, ACE could adapt effectively without labeled supervision and instead by
leveraging natural execution feedback. On the AppWorld leaderboard, ACE matches
the top-ranked production-level agent on the overall average and surpasses it
on the harder test-challenge split, despite using a smaller open-source model.
These results show that comprehensive, evolving contexts enable scalable,
efficient, and self-improving LLM systems with low overhead.

   title: Thinking with Camera: A Unified Multimodal Model for Camera-Centric
  Understanding and Generation
   summary: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

   title: Efficient Long-context Language Model Training by Core Attention
  Disaggregation
   summary: We present core attention disaggregation (CAD), a technique that improves
long-context large language model training by decoupling the core attention
computation, softmax(QK^T)V, from the rest of the model and executing it on a
separate pool of devices. In existing systems, core attention is colocated with
other layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to
the near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers
across data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations.
First, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only
minimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks.
Second, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when
processing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD
partitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to
dedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize
compute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system
called DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap
communication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to
reduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens,
DistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data
and pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory
balance.

   ai_summary: CAD, a technique for long-context large language model training, improves throughput and balance by decoupling and distributing core attention computations.

   title: ReCode: Unify Plan and Action for Universal Granularity Control
   summary: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel
at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is
fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large
Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate
fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing
paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and
low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.
We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses
this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code
representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as
abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes
into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This
recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,
enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.
Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,
multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical
decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly
surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates
exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that
unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful
and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is
available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.

   title: Kimi Linear: An Expressive, Efficient Attention Architecture
   summary: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

   title: Paper2Video: Automatic Video Generation from Scientific Papers
   summary: Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research
communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often
requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10
minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves
distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal
information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple
aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To
address these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101
research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and
speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta
Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos
convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we
propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation
video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout
refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding,
subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing
slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate
that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and
informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward
automated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and
code are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.
   id: 2510.05096

   title: The End of Manual Decoding: Towards Truly End-to-End Language Models
   summary: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

   title: Every Attention Matters: An Efficient Hybrid Architecture for
  Long-Context Reasoning
   summary: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

   title: When Models Lie, We Learn: Multilingual Span-Level Hallucination
  Detection with PsiloQA
   summary: Hallucination detection remains a fundamental challenge for the safe and
reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs), especially in applications
requiring factual accuracy. Existing hallucination benchmarks often operate at
the sequence level and are limited to English, lacking the fine-grained,
multilingual supervision needed for a comprehensive evaluation. In this work,
we introduce PsiloQA, a large-scale, multilingual dataset annotated with
span-level hallucinations across 14 languages. PsiloQA is constructed through
an automated three-stage pipeline: generating question-answer pairs from
Wikipedia using GPT-4o, eliciting potentially hallucinated answers from diverse
LLMs in a no-context setting, and automatically annotating hallucinated spans
using GPT-4o by comparing against golden answers and retrieved context. We
evaluate a wide range of hallucination detection methods -- including
uncertainty quantification, LLM-based tagging, and fine-tuned encoder models --
and show that encoder-based models achieve the strongest performance across
languages. Furthermore, PsiloQA demonstrates effective cross-lingual
generalization and supports robust knowledge transfer to other benchmarks, all
while being significantly more cost-efficient than human-annotated datasets.
Our dataset and results advance the development of scalable, fine-grained
hallucination detection in multilingual settings.

   title: LightMem: Lightweight and Efficient Memory-Augmented Generation
   summary: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle
to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and
complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless
interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and
utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce
substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new
memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance
and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of
human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,
cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information
through lightweight compression and groups information according to their
topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based
groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,
long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that
decouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with
GPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in
accuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API
calls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x. The code is available at
https://github.com/zjunlp/LightMem.

   title: PaddleOCR-VL: Boosting Multilingual Document Parsing via a 0.9B Ultra-Compact Vision-Language Model
   summary: In this report, we propose PaddleOCR-VL, a SOTA and resource-efficient model tailored for document parsing. Its core component is PaddleOCR-VL-0.9B, a compact yet powerful vision-language model (VLM) that integrates a NaViT-style dynamic resolution visual encoder with the ERNIE-4.5-0.3B language model to enable accurate element recognition. This innovative model efficiently supports 109 languages and excels in recognizing complex elements (e.g., text, tables, formulas, and charts), while maintaining minimal resource consumption. Through comprehensive evaluations on widely used public benchmarks and in-house benchmarks, PaddleOCR-VL achieves SOTA performance in both page-level document parsing and element-level recognition. It significantly outperforms existing solutions, exhibits strong competitiveness against top-tier VLMs, and delivers fast inference speeds. These strengths make it highly suitable for practical deployment in real-world scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR .

   title: Advancing End-to-End Pixel Space Generative Modeling via Self-supervised
  Pre-training
   summary: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

   title: MM-HELIX: Boosting Multimodal Long-Chain Reflective Reasoning with
  Holistic Platform and Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
   summary: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

   title: Emu3.5: Native Multimodal Models are World Learners
   summary: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at
https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

   title: LongCodeZip: Compress Long Context for Code Language Models
   summary: Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information
in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs,
high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing
context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for
general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to
suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose
LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed
specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1)
coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks
using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only
the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments
retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal
subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across
multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question
answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods,
achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By
effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information,
LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code
scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence
applications.

   summary: Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research
reports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with
the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based
data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain
fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their
reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B,
the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of
automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to
analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science
tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates
the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to
progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world
environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework
that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,
DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data
question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data
research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze
outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary
LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,
paving the way toward autonomous data science.

   title: In-the-Flow Agentic System Optimization for Effective Planning and Tool
  Use
   summary: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

   title: Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization
   summary: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

   title: Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Representation Learning
   summary: Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising
results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain
underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based
approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative
pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals
within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through
analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm
that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve
as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a
Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive
experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its
effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.
Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),
showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive
refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This
suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm
for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of
GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on
its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource
visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining
before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding
capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at

   title: DeepAgent: A General Reasoning Agent with Scalable Toolsets
   summary: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code
and demo are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/DeepAgent.

   title: InteractComp: Evaluating Search Agents With Ambiguous Queries
   summary: Language agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in web search and
information retrieval. However, these search agents assume user queries are
complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users
begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet
most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing
benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce
InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can
recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search.
Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we
construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a
target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only
through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best
model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context,
exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced
interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current
strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities
stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold,
revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate
feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for
both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents. The
code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/InteractComp.

   title: Cache-to-Cache: Direct Semantic Communication Between Large Language
  Models
   summary: Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large
Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a
single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing
internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This
process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token
generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs
communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache
semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,
supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,
we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic
communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the
source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic
transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit
from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the
deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit
intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%
higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text
communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average
2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at
https://github.com/thu-nics/C2C.

   title: JanusCoder: Towards a Foundational Visual-Programmatic Interface for
  Code Intelligence
   summary: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based
source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This
visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content
generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,
progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,
a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To
address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling
perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages
reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a
large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex
interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we
construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This
powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish
a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,
visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from
existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive
experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale
models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.
Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing
programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will
are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

   title: DITING: A Multi-Agent Evaluation Framework for Benchmarking Web Novel
  Translation
   summary: Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine translation
(MT), yet their effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear.
Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the
distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING,
the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation,
assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom
translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency,
zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K
expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval,
a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert
deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving
the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic
metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation
dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality
scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial
models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts,
and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent
translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web
novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.

   title: Self-Forcing++: Towards Minute-Scale High-Quality Video Generation
   summary: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon
videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/

   title: OmniVinci: Enhancing Architecture and Data for Omni-Modal Understanding
  LLM
   summary: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive
across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce
OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to
Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream
applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

   title: GEM: A Gym for Agentic LLMs
   summary: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

   title: DeepSeek-OCR: Contexts Optical Compression
   summary: We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of
compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two
components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically,
DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations
under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure
an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when
the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a
compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of
97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at
about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as
historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs.
Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On
OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision
tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while
utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can
generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a
single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at
http://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR.

   title: Video-Thinker: Sparking "Thinking with Videos" via Reinforcement
  Learning
   summary: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with
Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been
extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker,
which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their
intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues
throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct
Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within
chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.
Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate
grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for
constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks
and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including
Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B
substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

   title: WithAnyone: Towards Controllable and ID Consistent Image Generation
   summary: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

   title: KORMo: Korean Open Reasoning Model for Everyone
   summary: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a
fully open bilingual large language model (LLM) for a non-English language,
specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce
KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English
corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic
experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated
with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not
cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore,
the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight
multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and
instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model
collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning
and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including
data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent
framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in
low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual
LLM research.

   title: BAPO: Stabilizing Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for LLMs via
  Balanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping
   summary: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

   title: ExGRPO: Learning to Reason from Experience
   summary: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

   title: More Thought, Less Accuracy? On the Dual Nature of Reasoning in
  Vision-Language Models
   summary: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

   title: World-in-World: World Models in a Closed-Loop World
   summary: Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual
realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied
agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this
question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks
adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving
the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help
agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce
World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop
world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides
a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling
heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments
that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary
metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the
first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study
uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task
success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with
action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video
generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to
substantially improve closed-loop performance.

   title: Thinking with Video: Video Generation as a Promising Multimodal
  Reasoning Paradigm
   summary: "Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly
improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision
Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)
Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or
continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct
modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm
that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and
textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,
we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench
encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing
Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our
evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,
Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even
surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric
tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.
Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also
find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's
performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation
model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,
positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.

   title: Lumine: An Open Recipe for Building Generalist Agents in 3D Open Worlds
   summary: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

   title: MiroThinker: Pushing the Performance Boundaries of Open-Source Research Agents via Model, Context, and Interactive Scaling
   summary: We present MiroThinker v1.0, an open-source research agent designed to advance tool-augmented reasoning and information-seeking capabilities. Unlike previous agents that only scale up model size or context length, MiroThinker explores interaction scaling at the model level, systematically training the model to handle deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions as a third dimension of performance improvement. Unlike LLM test-time scaling, which operates in isolation and risks degradation with longer reasoning chains, interactive scaling leverages environment feedback and external information acquisition to correct errors and refine trajectories. Through reinforcement learning, the model achieves efficient interaction scaling: with a 256K context window, it can perform up to 600 tool calls per task, enabling sustained multi-turn reasoning and complex real-world research workflows. Across four representative benchmarks-GAIA, HLE, BrowseComp, and BrowseComp-ZH-the 72B variant achieves up to 81.9%, 37.7%, 47.1%, and 55.6% accuracy respectively, surpassing previous open-source agents and approaching commercial counterparts such as GPT-5-high. Our analysis reveals that MiroThinker benefits from interactive scaling consistently: research performance improves predictably as the model engages in deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions, demonstrating that interaction depth exhibits scaling behaviors analogous to model size and context length. These findings establish interaction scaling as a third critical dimension for building next-generation open research agents, complementing model capacity and context windows.

   title: General Agentic Memory Via Deep Research
   summary: Memory is critical for AI agents, yet the widely-adopted static memory, aiming to create readily available memory in advance, is inevitably subject to severe information loss. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework called general agentic memory (GAM). GAM follows the principle of "just-in time (JIT) compilation" where it focuses on creating optimized contexts for its client at runtime while keeping only simple but useful memory during the offline stage. To this end, GAM employs a duo-design with the following components. 1) Memorizer, which highlights key historical information using a lightweight memory, while maintaining complete historical information within a universal page-store. 2) Researcher, which retrieves and integrates useful information from the page-store for its online request guided by the pre-constructed memory. This design allows GAM to effectively leverage the agentic capabilities and test-time scalability of frontier large language models (LLMs), while also facilitating end-to-end performance optimization through reinforcement learning. In our experimental study, we demonstrate that GAM achieves substantial improvement on various memory-grounded task completion scenarios against existing memory systems.

   title: Souper-Model: How Simple Arithmetic Unlocks State-of-the-Art LLM Performance
   summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, but their training remains resource- and time-intensive, requiring massive compute power and careful orchestration of training procedures. Model souping-the practice of averaging weights from multiple models of the same architecture-has emerged as a promising pre- and post-training technique that can enhance performance without expensive retraining. In this paper, we introduce Soup Of Category Experts (SoCE), a principled approach for model souping that utilizes benchmark composition to identify optimal model candidates and applies non-uniform weighted averaging to maximize performance. Contrary to previous uniform-averaging approaches, our method leverages the observation that benchmark categories often exhibit low inter-correlations in model performance. SoCE identifies "expert" models for each weakly-correlated category cluster and combines them using optimized weighted averaging rather than uniform weights. We demonstrate that the proposed method improves performance and robustness across multiple domains, including multilingual capabilities, tool calling, and math and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard.

   title: P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning
   summary: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has moved the frontier from puzzle-solving to science-grade reasoning-the kind needed to tackle problems whose answers must stand against nature, not merely fit a rubric. Physics is the sharpest test of this shift, which binds symbols to reality in a fundamental way, serving as the cornerstone of most modern technologies. In this work, we manage to advance physics research by developing large language models with exceptional physics reasoning capabilities, especially excel at solving Olympiad-level physics problems. We introduce P1, a family of open-source physics reasoning models trained entirely through reinforcement learning (RL). Among them, P1-235B-A22B is the first open-source model with Gold-medal performance at the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO 2025), and wins 12 gold medals out of 13 international/regional physics competitions in 2024/2025. P1-30B-A3B also surpasses almost all other open-source models on IPhO 2025, getting a silver medal. Further equipped with an agentic framework PhysicsMinions, P1-235B-A22B+PhysicsMinions achieves overall No.1 on IPhO 2025, and obtains the highest average score over the 13 physics competitions. Besides physics, P1 models also present great performance on other reasoning tasks like math and coding, showing the great generalibility of P1 series.

   title: Tiny Model, Big Logic: Diversity-Driven Optimization Elicits Large-Model
  Reasoning Ability in VibeThinker-1.5B
   summary: Challenging the prevailing consensus that small models inherently lack robust
reasoning, this report introduces VibeThinker-1.5B, a 1.5B-parameter dense
model developed via our Spectrum-to-Signal Principle (SSP). This challenges the
prevailing approach of scaling model parameters to enhance capabilities, as
seen in models like DeepSeek R1 (671B) and Kimi k2 (>1T). The SSP framework
first employs a Two-Stage Diversity-Exploring Distillation (SFT) to generate a
broad spectrum of solutions, followed by MaxEnt-Guided Policy Optimization (RL)
to amplify the correct signal. With a total training cost of only $7,800,
VibeThinker-1.5B demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities compared to
closed-source models like Magistral Medium and Claude Opus 4, and performs on
par with open-source models like GPT OSS-20B Medium. Remarkably, it surpasses
the 400x larger DeepSeek R1 on three math benchmarks: AIME24 (80.3 vs. 79.8),
AIME25 (74.4 vs. 70.0), and HMMT25 (50.4 vs. 41.7). This is a substantial
improvement over its base model (6.7, 4.3, and 0.6, respectively). On
LiveCodeBench V6, it scores 51.1, outperforming Magistral Medium's 50.3 and its
base model's 0.0. These findings demonstrate that small models can achieve
reasoning capabilities comparable to large models, drastically reducing
training and inference costs and thereby democratizing advanced AI research.

   title: Diffusion Language Models are Super Data Learners
   summary: Under strictly controlled pre-training settings, we observe a Crossover: when
unique data is limited, diffusion language models (DLMs) consistently surpass
autoregressive (AR) models by training for more epochs. The crossover shifts
later with more or higher-quality data, earlier with larger models, and
persists across dense and sparse architectures. We attribute the gains to three
compounding factors: (1) any-order modeling, (2) super-dense compute from
iterative bidirectional denoising, and (3) built-in Monte Carlo augmentation;
input or parameter noise improves AR under data constraint but cannot close the
gap. At scale, a 1.7B DLM trained with a ~1.5T-token compute budget on 10B
unique Python tokens overtakes an AR coder trained with strictly matched
settings. In addition, a 1B-parameter DLM achieves > 56% accuracy on HellaSwag
and > 33% on MMLU using only 1B tokens, without any special tricks, just by
repeating standard pre-training data. We also show that rising validation
cross-entropy does not imply degraded downstream performance in this regime.

   title: SAM 3: Segment Anything with Concepts
   summary: We present Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3, a unified model that detects, segments, and tracks objects in images and videos based on concept prompts, which we define as either short noun phrases (e.g., "yellow school bus"), image exemplars, or a combination of both. Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) takes such prompts and returns segmentation masks and unique identities for all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build a scalable data engine that produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of an image-level detector and a memory-based video tracker that share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with a presence head, which boosts detection accuracy. SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks. We open source SAM 3 along with our new Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co) benchmark for promptable concept segmentation.

   title: One Small Step in Latent, One Giant Leap for Pixels: Fast Latent Upscale Adapter for Your Diffusion Models
   summary: Diffusion models struggle to scale beyond their training resolutions, as direct high-resolution sampling is slow and costly, while post-hoc image super-resolution (ISR) introduces artifacts and additional latency by operating after decoding. We present the Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA), a lightweight module that performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final VAE decoding step. LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LUA closely matches the fidelity of native high-resolution generation while offering a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in modern diffusion pipelines.

   title: TiDAR: Think in Diffusion, Talk in Autoregression
   summary: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

   ai_summary: TiDAR combines diffusion and autoregressive models to achieve high throughput and quality in language generation.

   title: Latent Collaboration in Multi-Agent Systems
   summary: Multi-agent systems (MAS) extend large language models (LLMs) from independent single-model reasoning to coordinative system-level intelligence. While existing LLM agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space. We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference. These results demonstrate that our new latent collaboration framework enhances system-level reasoning quality while offering substantial efficiency gains without any additional training. Code and data are fully open-sourced at https://github.com/Gen-Verse/LatentMAS.

   title: GigaEvo: An Open Source Optimization Framework Powered By LLMs And Evolution Algorithms
   summary: Recent advances in LLM-guided evolutionary computation, particularly AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025; Georgiev et al., 2025), have demonstrated remarkable success in discovering novel mathematical constructions and solving challenging optimization problems. However, the high-level descriptions in published work leave many implementation details unspecified, hindering reproducibility and further research. In this report we present GigaEvo, an extensible open-source framework that enables researchers to study and experiment with hybrid LLM-evolution approaches inspired by AlphaEvolve. Our system provides modular implementations of key components: MAP-Elites quality-diversity algorithms, asynchronous DAG-based evaluation pipelines, LLM-driven mutation operators with insight generation and bidirectional lineage tracking, and flexible multi-island evolutionary strategies. In order to assess reproducibility and validate our implementation we evaluate GigaEvo on challenging problems from the AlphaEvolve paper: Heilbronn triangle placement, circle packing in squares, and high-dimensional kissing numbers. The framework emphasizes modularity, concurrency, and ease of experimentation, enabling rapid prototyping through declarative configuration. We provide detailed descriptions of system architecture, implementation decisions, and experimental methodology to support further research in LLM driven evolutionary methods. The GigaEvo framework and all experimental code are available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/gigaevo-core.

   title: VIDEOP2R: Video Understanding from Perception to Reasoning
   summary: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

   title: SAM 3D: 3Dfy Anything in Images
   summary: We present SAM 3D, a generative model for visually grounded 3D object reconstruction, predicting geometry, texture, and layout from a single image. SAM 3D excels in natural images, where occlusion and scene clutter are common and visual recognition cues from context play a larger role. We achieve this with a human- and model-in-the-loop pipeline for annotating object shape, texture, and pose, providing visually grounded 3D reconstruction data at unprecedented scale. We learn from this data in a modern, multi-stage training framework that combines synthetic pretraining with real-world alignment, breaking the 3D "data barrier". We obtain significant gains over recent work, with at least a 5:1 win rate in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes. We will release our code and model weights, an online demo, and a new challenging benchmark for in-the-wild 3D object reconstruction.

   title: Agent0: Unleashing Self-Evolving Agents from Zero Data via Tool-Integrated Reasoning
   summary: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents, often trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL), are constrained by a dependency on human-curated data, limiting scalability and tethering AI to human knowledge. Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula. Empirically, Agent0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities, improving the Qwen3-8B-Base model by 18% on mathematical reasoning and 24% on general reasoning benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/Agent0.

   title: Think-at-Hard: Selective Latent Iterations to Improve Reasoning Language Models
   summary: Improving reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially under parameter constraints, is crucial for real-world applications. Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/TaH.

   title: Grounding Computer Use Agents on Human Demonstrations
   summary: Building reliable computer-use agents requires grounding: accurately
connecting natural language instructions to the correct on-screen elements.
While large datasets exist for web and mobile interactions, high-quality
resources for desktop environments are limited. To address this gap, we
introduce GroundCUA, a large-scale desktop grounding dataset built from expert
human demonstrations. It covers 87 applications across 12 categories and
includes 56K screenshots, with every on-screen element carefully annotated for
a total of over 3.56M human-verified annotations. From these demonstrations, we
generate diverse instructions that capture a wide range of real-world tasks,
providing high-quality data for model training. Using GroundCUA, we develop the
GroundNext family of models that map instructions to their target UI elements.
At both 3B and 7B scales, GroundNext achieves state-of-the-art results across
five benchmarks using supervised fine-tuning, while requiring less than
one-tenth the training data of prior work. Reinforcement learning post-training
further improves performance, and when evaluated in an agentic setting on the
OSWorld benchmark using o3 as planner, GroundNext attains comparable or
superior results to models trained with substantially more data,. These results
demonstrate the critical role of high-quality, expert-driven datasets in
advancing general-purpose computer-use agents.

   title: Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni: Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Large Model with Advanced MoE, Training and Data
   summary: We present Uni-MoE 2.0 from the Lychee family. As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee's Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the Qwen2.5-7B dense architecture, we build Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech. Architecturally, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer. For training, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning. Data-wise, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues. Extensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves SOTA or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (reducing WER by 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.

   title: VCode: a Multimodal Coding Benchmark with SVG as Symbolic Visual
  Representation
   summary: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines
SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply
structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic
capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities
score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D
reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing
Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on
rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual
representation. The benchmark and code are available at

   title: V-Thinker: Interactive Thinking with Images
   summary: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

   title: Don't Blind Your VLA: Aligning Visual Representations for OOD
  Generalization
   summary: The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:

   title: Depth Anything 3: Recovering the Visual Space from Any Views
   summary: We present Depth Anything 3 (DA3), a model that predicts spatially consistent geometry from an arbitrary number of visual inputs, with or without known camera poses. In pursuit of minimal modeling, DA3 yields two key insights: a single plain transformer (e.g., vanilla DINO encoder) is sufficient as a backbone without architectural specialization, and a singular depth-ray prediction target obviates the need for complex multi-task learning. Through our teacher-student training paradigm, the model achieves a level of detail and generalization on par with Depth Anything 2 (DA2). We establish a new visual geometry benchmark covering camera pose estimation, any-view geometry and visual rendering. On this benchmark, DA3 sets a new state-of-the-art across all tasks, surpassing prior SOTA VGGT by an average of 44.3% in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy. Moreover, it outperforms DA2 in monocular depth estimation. All models are trained exclusively on public academic datasets.

   title: DoPE: Denoising Rotary Position Embedding
   summary: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

   title: GeoVista: Web-Augmented Agentic Visual Reasoning for Geolocalization
   summary: Current research on agentic visual reasoning enables deep multimodal understanding but primarily focuses on image manipulation tools, leaving a gap toward more general-purpose agentic models. In this work, we revisit the geolocalization task, which requires not only nuanced visual grounding but also web search to confirm or refine hypotheses during reasoning. Since existing geolocalization benchmarks fail to meet the need for high-resolution imagery and the localization challenge for deep agentic reasoning, we curate GeoBench, a benchmark that includes photos and panoramas from around the world, along with a subset of satellite images of different cities to rigorously evaluate the geolocalization ability of agentic models. We also propose GeoVista, an agentic model that seamlessly integrates tool invocation within the reasoning loop, including an image-zoom-in tool to magnify regions of interest and a web-search tool to retrieve related web information. We develop a complete training pipeline for it, including a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to learn reasoning patterns and tool-use priors, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) stage to further enhance reasoning ability. We adopt a hierarchical reward to leverage multi-level geographical information and improve overall geolocalization performance. Experimental results show that GeoVista surpasses other open-source agentic models on the geolocalization task greatly and achieves performance comparable to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-flash and GPT-5 on most metrics.

   title: HaluMem: Evaluating Hallucinations in Memory Systems of Agents
   summary: Memory systems are key components that enable AI systems such as LLMs and AI
agents to achieve long-term learning and sustained interaction. However, during
memory storage and retrieval, these systems frequently exhibit memory
hallucinations, including fabrication, errors, conflicts, and omissions.
Existing evaluations of memory hallucinations are primarily end-to-end question
answering, which makes it difficult to localize the operational stage within
the memory system where hallucinations arise. To address this, we introduce the
Hallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem), the first operation level
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored to memory systems. HaluMem defines
three evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question
answering) to comprehensively reveal hallucination behaviors across different
operational stages of interaction. To support evaluation, we construct
user-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets, HaluMem-Medium and
HaluMem-Long. Both include about 15k memory points and 3.5k multi-type
questions. The average dialogue length per user reaches 1.5k and 2.6k turns,
with context lengths exceeding 1M tokens, enabling evaluation of hallucinations
across different context scales and task complexities. Empirical studies based
on HaluMem show that existing memory systems tend to generate and accumulate
hallucinations during the extraction and updating stages, which subsequently
propagate errors to the question answering stage. Future research should focus
on developing interpretable and constrained memory operation mechanisms that
systematically suppress hallucinations and improve memory reliability.

   ai_summary: HaluMem, a benchmark for evaluating memory hallucinations in AI systems, identifies and analyzes hallucinations across memory extraction, updating, and question answering stages using large-scale human-AI interaction datasets.

   title: OpenMMReasoner: Pushing the Frontiers for Multimodal Reasoning with an Open and General Recipe
   summary: Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.

   title: AutoEnv: Automated Environments for Measuring Cross-Environment Agent Learning
   summary: Humans naturally adapt to diverse environments by learning underlying rules across worlds with different dynamics, observations, and reward structures. In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning. The code is avaiable at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/AutoEnv.
   id: 2511.19304
   ai_summary: AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 provide a standardized framework and dataset for evaluating cross-environment learning in agents, highlighting the challenges and limitations of existing learning methods.

   title: Unveiling Intrinsic Dimension of Texts: from Academic Abstract to Creative Story
   summary: Intrinsic dimension (ID) is an important tool in modern LLM analysis, informing studies of training dynamics, scaling behavior, and dataset structure, yet its textual determinants remain underexplored. We provide the first comprehensive study grounding ID in interpretable text properties through cross-encoder analysis, linguistic features, and sparse autoencoders (SAEs). In this work, we establish three key findings. First, ID is complementary to entropy-based metrics: after controlling for length, the two are uncorrelated, with ID capturing geometric complexity orthogonal to prediction quality. Second, ID exhibits robust genre stratification: scientific prose shows low ID (~8), encyclopedic content medium ID (~9), and creative/opinion writing high ID (~10.5) across all models tested. This reveals that contemporary LLMs find scientific text "representationally simple" while fiction requires additional degrees of freedom. Third, using SAEs, we identify causal features: scientific signals (formal tone, report templates, statistics) reduce ID; humanized signals (personalization, emotion, narrative) increase it. Steering experiments confirm these effects are causal. Thus, for contemporary models, scientific writing appears comparatively "easy", whereas fiction, opinion, and affect add representational degrees of freedom. Our multi-faceted analysis provides practical guidance for the proper use of ID and the sound interpretation of ID-based results.
   id: 2511.15210
   ai_summary: The study explores intrinsic dimension in large language models through cross-encoder analysis, linguistic features, and sparse autoencoders, revealing its independence from entropy, genre-specific stratification, and causal features related to text type.

   title: ThinkMorph: Emergent Properties in Multimodal Interleaved
  Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
   summary: Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and
vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain
of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as
complementary, rather than isomorphic, modalities that mutually advance
reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model
fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with
varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image
reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining
coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks
(averaging 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks,
matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance,
ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual
manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better
test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts.These findings
suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of
unified models for multimodal reasoning.

   title: Every Activation Boosted: Scaling General Reasoner to 1 Trillion Open
  Language Foundation
   summary: We introduce Ling 2.0, a series reasoning-oriented language foundation built
upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability. Designed
to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, Ling 2.0 emphasizes high sparsity,
cross-scale consistency, and efficiency guided by empirical scaling laws. The
series includes three non-thinking (instruct) models - Ling-mini-2.0,
Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T total parameters and
achieving up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared with dense
counterparts. Ling 2.0 integrates coordinated innovations across model
architecture, pre-training, post-training, and infrastructure: a high-sparsity
MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data and mid-training
CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale
FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines. At the trillion scale,
Ling-1T establishes a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus
computational efficiency, demonstrating that sparse activation, when properly
aligned with reasoning objectives, enables scalable and efficient intelligence.
Collectively, Ling 2.0 provides a coherent, open, and efficient foundation for
advancing future reasoning and thinking models, including the Ring series built
upon the same base.

   title: Scaling Agent Learning via Experience Synthesis
   summary: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.
   id: 2511.03773
   ai_summary: DreamGym is a unified framework that synthesizes diverse experiences for scalable online RL training, improving agent performance and reducing real-world interactions.

   title: Multimodal Evaluation of Russian-language Architectures
   summary: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are currently at the center of research attention, showing rapid progress in scale and capabilities, yet their intelligence, limitations, and risks remain insufficiently understood. To address these issues, particularly in the context of the Russian language, where no multimodal benchmarks currently exist, we introduce Mera Multi, an open multimodal evaluation framework for Russian-spoken architectures. The benchmark is instruction-based and encompasses default text, image, audio, and video modalities, comprising 18 newly constructed evaluation tasks for both general-purpose models and modality-specific architectures (image-to-text, video-to-text, and audio-to-text). Our contributions include: (i) a universal taxonomy of multimodal abilities; (ii) 18 datasets created entirely from scratch with attention to Russian cultural and linguistic specificity, unified prompts, and metrics; (iii) baseline results for both closed-source and open-source models; (iv) a methodology for preventing benchmark leakage, including watermarking and licenses for private sets. While our current focus is on Russian, the proposed benchmark provides a replicable methodology for constructing multimodal benchmarks in typologically diverse languages, particularly within the Slavic language family.

   title: INT v.s. FP: A Comprehensive Study of Fine-Grained Low-bit Quantization
  Formats
   summary: Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly
embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive
activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry
trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying
granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design
without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically
investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical
performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the
comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our
comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained
formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart
in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit
formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we
show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like
Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method
that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling
nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the
current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach
is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly
MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI
accelerators.
   id: 2510.25602
   ai_summary: A comprehensive comparison of low-precision floating-point and integer quantization in large language models reveals that fine-grained integer formats, especially MXINT8, offer superior accuracy and efficiency over floating-point formats in many cases.

   title: PAN: A World Model for General, Interactable, and Long-Horizon World Simulation
   summary: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

   title: IterResearch: Rethinking Long-Horizon Agents via Markovian State
  Reconstruction
   summary: Recent advances in deep-research agents have shown promise for autonomous
knowledge construction through dynamic reasoning over external sources.
However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that
accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to
context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on
long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research
paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process
with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as
memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves
consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further
develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning
framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward
discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six
benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably,
our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048
interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\% to 42.5\%), and serves
as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp
over ReAct on long-horizon tasks. These findings position IterResearch as a
versatile solution for long-horizon reasoning, effective both as a trained
agent and as a prompting paradigm for frontier models.
   id: 2511.07327

   title: Reasoning via Video: The First Evaluation of Video Models' Reasoning Abilities through Maze-Solving Tasks
   summary: Video Models have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity video generation with coherent motion dynamics. Analogous to the development from text generation to text-based reasoning in language modeling, the development of video models motivates us to ask: Can video models reason via video generation? Compared with the discrete text corpus, video grounds reasoning in explicit spatial layouts and temporal continuity, which serves as an ideal substrate for spatial reasoning. In this work, we explore the reasoning via video paradigm and introduce VR-Bench -- a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate video models' reasoning capabilities. Grounded in maze-solving tasks that inherently require spatial planning and multi-step reasoning, VR-Bench contains 7,920 procedurally generated videos across five maze types and diverse visual styles. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that SFT can efficiently elicit the reasoning ability of video model. Video models exhibit stronger spatial perception during reasoning, outperforming leading VLMs and generalizing well across diverse scenarios, tasks, and levels of complexity. We further discover a test-time scaling effect, where diverse sampling during inference improves reasoning reliability by 10--20%. These findings highlight the unique potential and scalability of reasoning via video for spatial reasoning tasks.

   title: AraLingBench A Human-Annotated Benchmark for Evaluating Arabic Linguistic Capabilities of Large Language Models
   summary: We present AraLingBench: a fully human annotated benchmark for evaluating the Arabic linguistic competence of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark spans five core categories: grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax, through 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions that directly assess structural language understanding. Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. AraLingBench highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension. By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.

   title: OS-Sentinel: Towards Safety-Enhanced Mobile GUI Agents via Hybrid
  Validation in Realistic Workflows
   summary: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like
mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

   title: Part-X-MLLM: Part-aware 3D Multimodal Large Language Model
   summary: We introduce Part-X-MLLM, a native 3D multimodal large language model that unifies diverse 3D tasks by formulating them as programs in a structured, executable grammar. Given an RGB point cloud and a natural language prompt, our model autoregressively generates a single, coherent token sequence encoding part-level bounding boxes, semantic descriptions, and edit commands. This structured output serves as a versatile interface to drive downstream geometry-aware modules for part-based generation and editing. By decoupling the symbolic planning from the geometric synthesis, our approach allows any compatible geometry engine to be controlled through a single, language-native frontend. We pre-train a dual-encoder architecture to disentangle structure from semantics and instruction-tune the model on a large-scale, part-centric dataset. Experiments demonstrate that our model excels at producing high-quality, structured plans, enabling state-of-the-art performance in grounded Q\&A, compositional generation, and localized editing through one unified interface.

   title: Continuous Autoregressive Language Models
   summary: The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by
their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming
this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the
semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce
Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from
discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses
a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single
continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with
over 99.9\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of
continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of
generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new
modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free
framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling
in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the
performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete
baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these
findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway
towards ultra-efficient language models. Code:

   summary: While thinking-aware generation aims to improve performance on complex tasks, we identify a critical failure mode where existing sequential, autoregressive approaches can paradoxically degrade performance due to error propagation. To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/tyfeld/MMaDA-Parallel

   title: Back to Basics: Let Denoising Generative Models Denoise
   summary: Today's denoising diffusion models do not "denoise" in the classical sense, i.e., they do not directly predict clean images. Rather, the neural networks predict noise or a noised quantity. In this paper, we suggest that predicting clean data and predicting noised quantities are fundamentally different. According to the manifold assumption, natural data should lie on a low-dimensional manifold, whereas noised quantities do not. With this assumption, we advocate for models that directly predict clean data, which allows apparently under-capacity networks to operate effectively in very high-dimensional spaces. We show that simple, large-patch Transformers on pixels can be strong generative models: using no tokenizer, no pre-training, and no extra loss. Our approach is conceptually nothing more than "Just image Transformers", or JiT, as we call it. We report competitive results using JiT with large patch sizes of 16 and 32 on ImageNet at resolutions of 256 and 512, where predicting high-dimensional noised quantities can fail catastrophically. With our networks mapping back to the basics of the manifold, our research goes back to basics and pursues a self-contained paradigm for Transformer-based diffusion on raw natural data.

   title: π_RL: Online RL Fine-tuning for Flow-based
  Vision-Language-Action Models
   summary: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., pi_0, pi_{0.5}) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with pi_{RL}, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. pi_{RL}
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate pi_{RL} on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
pi_{RL} boosts few-shot SFT models pi_0 and pi_{0.5} from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
pi_{RL} in 320 parallel environments, improving pi_0 from 41.6% to
85.7% and pi_{0.5} from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, pi_{RL} achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

   title: DeCo: Frequency-Decoupled Pixel Diffusion for End-to-End Image Generation
   summary: Pixel diffusion aims to generate images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end fashion. This approach avoids the limitations of VAE in the two-stage latent diffusion, offering higher model capacity. Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference, as they usually model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer (DiT). To pursue a more efficient pixel diffusion paradigm, we propose the frequency-DeCoupled pixel diffusion framework. With the intuition to decouple the generation of high and low frequency components, we leverage a lightweight pixel decoder to generate high-frequency details conditioned on semantic guidance from the DiT. This thus frees the DiT to specialize in modeling low-frequency semantics. In addition, we introduce a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies while suppressing insignificant ones. Extensive experiments show that DeCo achieves superior performance among pixel diffusion models, attaining FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods. Furthermore, our pretrained text-to-image model achieves a leading overall score of 0.86 on GenEval in system-level comparison. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Zehong-Ma/DeCo.

   title: A Style is Worth One Code: Unlocking Code-to-Style Image Generation with Discrete Style Space
   summary: Innovative visual stylization is a cornerstone of artistic creation, yet generating novel and consistent visual styles remains a significant challenge. Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.

   title: DR Tulu: Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics for Deep Research
   summary: Deep research models perform multi-step research to produce long-form, well-attributed answers. However, most open deep research models are trained on easily verifiable short-form QA tasks via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which does not extend to realistic long-form tasks. We address this with Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training; this allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored and to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback. Using RLER, we develop Deep Research Tulu (DR Tulu-8B), the first open model that is directly trained for open-ended, long-form deep research. Across four long-form deep research benchmarks in science, healthcare and general domains, DR Tulu substantially outperforms existing open deep research models, and matches or exceeds proprietary deep research systems, while being significantly smaller and cheaper per query. To facilitate future research, we release all data, models, and code, including our new MCP-based agent infrastructure for deep research systems.

   title: When Visualizing is the First Step to Reasoning: MIRA, a Benchmark for
  Visual Chain-of-Thought
   summary: We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios
where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful
reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in
MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as
sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning
process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through
"drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically
challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning
steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our
evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,
annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a
unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation
input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with
image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image
clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity
on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under
different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large
language models, including strongest private models as well as strong
open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.
However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves
consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and
tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and
designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited
improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the
critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning
on MIRA.

   title: ROOT: Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer for Neural Network Training
   summary: The optimization of large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, particularly as model scaling exacerbates sensitivity to algorithmic imprecision and training instability. Recent advances in optimizers have improved convergence efficiency through momentum orthogonalization, but suffer from two key robustness limitations: dimensional fragility in orthogonalization precision and vulnerability to outlier-induced noise. To address these robustness challenges, we introduce ROOT, a Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer that enhances training stability through dual robustness mechanisms. First, we develop a dimension-robust orthogonalization scheme using adaptive Newton iterations with fine-grained coefficients tailored to specific matrix sizes, ensuring consistent precision across diverse architectural configurations. Second, we introduce an optimization-robust framework via proximal optimization that suppresses outlier noise while preserving meaningful gradient directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROOT achieves significantly improved robustness, with faster convergence and superior final performance compared to both Muon and Adam-based optimizers, particularly in noisy and non-convex scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for developing robust and precise optimizers capable of handling the complexities of modern large-scale model training. The code will be available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/ROOT.

   title: From Code Foundation Models to Agents and Applications: A Practical Guide to Code Intelligence
   summary: Large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed automated software development by enabling direct translation of natural language descriptions into functional code, driving commercial adoption through tools like Github Copilot (Microsoft), Cursor (Anysphere), Trae (ByteDance), and Claude Code (Anthropic). While the field has evolved dramatically from rule-based systems to Transformer-based architectures, achieving performance improvements from single-digit to over 95\% success rates on benchmarks like HumanEval. In this work, we provide a comprehensive synthesis and practical guide (a series of analytic and probing experiments) about code LLMs, systematically examining the complete model life cycle from data curation to post-training through advanced prompting paradigms, code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous coding agents. We analyze the code capability of the general LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) and code-specialized LLMs (StarCoder, Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, and QwenCoder), critically examining the techniques, design decisions, and trade-offs. Further, we articulate the research-practice gap between academic research (e.g., benchmarks and tasks) and real-world deployment (e.g., software-related code tasks), including code correctness, security, contextual awareness of large codebases, and integration with development workflows, and map promising research directions to practical needs. Last, we conduct a series of experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis of code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, covering scaling law, framework selection, hyperparameter sensitivity, model architectures, and dataset comparisons.

   summary: We introduce DeepSeek-V3.2, a model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with superior reasoning and agent performance.

   title: Z-Image: An Efficient Image Generation Foundation Model with Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer
   summary: The landscape of high-performance image generation models is currently dominated by proprietary systems, such as Nano Banana Pro and Seedream 4.0. Leading open-source alternatives, including Qwen-Image, Hunyuan-Image-3.0 and FLUX.2, are characterized by massive parameter counts (20B to 80B), making them impractical for inference, and fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. To address this gap, we propose Z-Image, an efficient 6B-parameter foundation generative model built upon a Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture that challenges the "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. By systematically optimizing the entire model lifecycle -- from a curated data infrastructure to a streamlined training curriculum -- we complete the full training workflow in just 314K H800 GPU hours (approx. $630K). Our few-step distillation scheme with reward post-training further yields Z-Image-Turbo, offering both sub-second inference latency on an enterprise-grade H800 GPU and compatibility with consumer-grade hardware (<16GB VRAM). Additionally, our omni-pre-training paradigm also enables efficient training of Z-Image-Edit, an editing model with impressive instruction-following capabilities. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to or surpassing that of leading competitors across various dimensions. Most notably, Z-Image exhibits exceptional capabilities in photorealistic image generation and bilingual text rendering, delivering results that rival top-tier commercial models, thereby demonstrating that state-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead. We publicly release our code, weights, and online demo to foster the development of accessible, budget-friendly, yet state-of-the-art generative models.

   title: DataFlow: An LLM-Driven Framework for Unified Data Preparation and Workflow Automation in the Era of Data-Centric AI
   summary: The rapidly growing demand for high-quality data in Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the need for scalable, reliable, and semantically rich data preparation pipelines. However, current practices remain dominated by ad-hoc scripts and loosely specified workflows, which lack principled abstractions, hinder reproducibility, and offer limited support for model-in-the-loop data generation. To address these challenges, we present DataFlow, a unified and extensible LLM-driven data preparation framework. DataFlow is designed with system-level abstractions that enable modular, reusable, and composable data transformations, and provides a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API for building debuggable and optimizable dataflows. The framework consists of nearly 200 reusable operators and six domain-general pipelines spanning text, mathematical reasoning, code, Text-to-SQL, agentic RAG, and large-scale knowledge extraction. To further improve usability, we introduce DataFlow-Agent, which automatically translates natural-language specifications into executable pipelines via operator synthesis, pipeline planning, and iterative verification. Across six representative use cases, DataFlow consistently improves downstream LLM performance. Our math, code, and text pipelines outperform curated human datasets and specialized synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3\% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7\% average improvements on code benchmarks, and 1--3 point gains on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME. Moreover, a unified 10K-sample dataset produced by DataFlow enables base models to surpass counterparts trained on 1M Infinity-Instruct data. These results demonstrate that DataFlow provides a practical and high-performance substrate for reliable, reproducible, and scalable LLM data preparation, and establishes a system-level foundation for future data-centric AI development.

   title: LongVT: Incentivizing "Thinking with Long Videos" via Native Tool Calling
   summary: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

   title: Live Avatar: Streaming Real-time Audio-Driven Avatar Generation with Infinite Length
   summary: Existing diffusion-based video generation methods are fundamentally constrained by sequential computation and long-horizon inconsistency, limiting their practical adoption in real-time, streaming audio-driven avatar synthesis. We present Live Avatar, an algorithm-system co-designed framework that enables efficient, high-fidelity, and infinite-length avatar generation using a 14-billion-parameter diffusion model. Our approach introduces Timestep-forcing Pipeline Parallelism (TPP), a distributed inference paradigm that pipelines denoising steps across multiple GPUs, effectively breaking the autoregressive bottleneck and ensuring stable, low-latency real-time streaming. To further enhance temporal consistency and mitigate identity drift and color artifacts, we propose the Rolling Sink Frame Mechanism (RSFM), which maintains sequence fidelity by dynamically recalibrating appearance using a cached reference image. Additionally, we leverage Self-Forcing Distribution Matching Distillation to facilitate causal, streamable adaptation of large-scale models without sacrificing visual quality. Live Avatar demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, reaching 20 FPS end-to-end generation on 5 H800 GPUs, and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve practical, real-time, high-fidelity avatar generation at this scale. Our work establishes a new paradigm for deploying advanced diffusion models in industrial long-form video synthesis applications.

   title: Kling-Omni Technical Report
   summary: We present Kling-Omni, a generalist generative framework designed to synthesize high-fidelity videos directly from multimodal visual language inputs. Adopting an end-to-end perspective, Kling-Omni bridges the functional separation among diverse video generation, editing, and intelligent reasoning tasks, integrating them into a holistic system. Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation. The framework is further empowered by efficient large-scale pre-training strategies and infrastructure optimizations for inference. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Kling-Omni demonstrates exceptional capabilities in in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and multimodal instruction following. Moving beyond a content creation tool, we believe Kling-Omni is a pivotal advancement toward multimodal world simulators capable of perceiving, reasoning, generating and interacting with the dynamic and complex worlds.

   title: DAComp: Benchmarking Data Agents across the Full Data Intelligence Lifecycle
   summary: Real-world enterprise data intelligence workflows encompass data engineering that turns raw sources into analytical-ready tables and data analysis that convert those tables into decision-oriented insights. We introduce DAComp, a benchmark of 210 tasks that mirrors these complex workflows. Data engineering (DE) tasks require repository-level engineering on industrial schemas, including designing and building multi-stage SQL pipelines from scratch and evolving existing systems under evolving requirements. Data analysis (DA) tasks pose open-ended business problems that demand strategic planning, exploratory analysis through iterative coding, interpretation of intermediate results, and the synthesis of actionable recommendations. Engineering tasks are scored through execution-based, multi-metric evaluation. Open-ended tasks are assessed by a reliable, experimentally validated LLM-judge, which is guided by hierarchical, meticulously crafted rubrics. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents falter on DAComp. Performance on DE tasks is particularly low, with success rates under 20%, exposing a critical bottleneck in holistic pipeline orchestration, not merely code generation. Scores on DA tasks also average below 40%, highlighting profound deficiencies in open-ended reasoning and demonstrating that engineering and analysis are distinct capabilities. By clearly diagnosing these limitations, DAComp provides a rigorous and realistic testbed to drive the development of truly capable autonomous data agents for enterprise settings. Our data and code are available at https://da-comp.github.io

   title: Qwen3-VL Technical Report
   summary: We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.

   title: Memory in the Age of AI Agents
   summary: Memory has emerged, and will continue to remain, a core capability of foundation model-based agents. As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence.

   title: Step-GUI Technical Report
   summary: Recent advances in multimodal large language models unlock unprecedented opportunities for GUI automation. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently acquire high-quality training data while maintaining annotation reliability? We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities. As GUI agent capabilities improve, practical deployment demands standardized interfaces across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy. To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, a benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%). Our work advances the development of practical GUI agents and demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in everyday digital interactions.

   title: Wan-Move: Motion-controllable Video Generation via Latent Trajectory Guidance
   summary: We present Wan-Move, a simple and scalable framework that brings motion control to video generative models. Existing motion-controllable methods typically suffer from coarse control granularity and limited scalability, leaving their outputs insufficient for practical use. We narrow this gap by achieving precise and high-quality motion control. Our core idea is to directly make the original condition features motion-aware for guiding video synthesis. To this end, we first represent object motions with dense point trajectories, allowing fine-grained control over the scene. We then project these trajectories into latent space and propagate the first frame's features along each trajectory, producing an aligned spatiotemporal feature map that tells how each scene element should move. This feature map serves as the updated latent condition, which is naturally integrated into the off-the-shelf image-to-video model, e.g., Wan-I2V-14B, as motion guidance without any architecture change. It removes the need for auxiliary motion encoders and makes fine-tuning base models easily scalable. Through scaled training, Wan-Move generates 5-second, 480p videos whose motion controllability rivals Kling 1.5 Pro's commercial Motion Brush, as indicated by user studies. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further design MoveBench, a rigorously curated benchmark featuring diverse content categories and hybrid-verified annotations. It is distinguished by larger data volume, longer video durations, and high-quality motion annotations.

   title: EgoX: Egocentric Video Generation from a Single Exocentric Video
   summary: Egocentric perception enables humans to experience and understand the world directly from their own point of view. Translating exocentric (third-person) videos into egocentric (first-person) videos opens up new possibilities for immersive understanding but remains highly challenging due to extreme camera pose variations and minimal view overlap. This task requires faithfully preserving visible content while synthesizing unseen regions in a geometrically consistent manner. To achieve this, we present EgoX, a novel framework for generating egocentric videos from a single exocentric input. EgoX leverages the pretrained spatio temporal knowledge of large-scale video diffusion models through lightweight LoRA adaptation and introduces a unified conditioning strategy that combines exocentric and egocentric priors via width and channel wise concatenation. Additionally, a geometry-guided self-attention mechanism selectively attends to spatially relevant regions, ensuring geometric coherence and high visual fidelity. Our approach achieves coherent and realistic egocentric video generation while demonstrating strong scalability and robustness across unseen and in-the-wild videos.

   title: ToolOrchestra: Elevating Intelligence via Efficient Model and Tool Orchestration
   summary: Large language models are powerful generalists, yet solving deep and complex problems such as those of the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) remains both conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools. These results demonstrate that composing diverse tools with a lightweight orchestration model is both more efficient and more effective than existing methods, paving the way for practical and scalable tool-augmented reasoning systems.

   title: MMGR: Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning
   summary: Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.

   title: Probing Scientific General Intelligence of LLMs with Scientist-Aligned Workflows
   summary: Despite advances in scientific AI, a coherent framework for Scientific General Intelligence (SGI)-the ability to autonomously conceive, investigate, and reason across scientific domains-remains lacking. We present an operational SGI definition grounded in the Practical Inquiry Model (PIM: Deliberation, Conception, Action, Perception) and operationalize it via four scientist-aligned tasks: deep research, idea generation, dry/wet experiments, and experimental reasoning. SGI-Bench comprises over 1,000 expert-curated, cross-disciplinary samples inspired by Science's 125 Big Questions, enabling systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal gaps: low exact match (10--20%) in deep research despite step-level alignment; ideas lacking feasibility and detail; high code executability but low execution result accuracy in dry experiments; low sequence fidelity in wet protocols; and persistent multimodal comparative-reasoning challenges. We further introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which optimizes retrieval-augmented novelty rewards at inference, enhancing hypothesis novelty without reference answer. Together, our PIM-grounded definition, workflow-centric benchmark, and empirical insights establish a foundation for AI systems that genuinely participate in scientific discovery.

   title: Mindscape-Aware Retrieval Augmented Generation for Improved Long Context Understanding
   summary: Humans understand long and complex texts by relying on a holistic semantic representation of the content. This global view helps organize prior knowledge, interpret new information, and integrate evidence dispersed across a document, as revealed by the Mindscape-Aware Capability of humans in psychology. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems lack such guidance and therefore struggle with long-context tasks. In this paper, we propose Mindscape-Aware RAG (MiA-RAG), the first approach that equips LLM-based RAG systems with explicit global context awareness. MiA-RAG builds a mindscape through hierarchical summarization and conditions both retrieval and generation on this global semantic representation. This enables the retriever to form enriched query embeddings and the generator to reason over retrieved evidence within a coherent global context. We evaluate MiA-RAG across diverse long-context and bilingual benchmarks for evidence-based understanding and global sense-making. It consistently surpasses baselines, and further analysis shows that it aligns local details with a coherent global representation, enabling more human-like long-context retrieval and reasoning.

   title: QwenLong-L1.5: Post-Training Recipe for Long-Context Reasoning and Memory Management
   summary: We introduce QwenLong-L1.5, a model that achieves superior long-context reasoning capabilities through systematic post-training innovations. The key technical breakthroughs of QwenLong-L1.5 are as follows: (1) Long-Context Data Synthesis Pipeline: We develop a systematic synthesis framework that generates challenging reasoning tasks requiring multi-hop grounding over globally distributed evidence. By deconstructing documents into atomic facts and their underlying relationships, and then programmatically composing verifiable reasoning questions, our approach creates high-quality training data at scale, moving substantially beyond simple retrieval tasks to enable genuine long-range reasoning capabilities. (2) Stabilized Reinforcement Learning for Long-Context Training: To overcome the critical instability in long-context RL, we introduce task-balanced sampling with task-specific advantage estimation to mitigate reward bias, and propose Adaptive Entropy-Controlled Policy Optimization (AEPO) that dynamically regulates exploration-exploitation trade-offs. (3) Memory-Augmented Architecture for Ultra-Long Contexts: Recognizing that even extended context windows cannot accommodate arbitrarily long sequences, we develop a memory management framework with multi-stage fusion RL training that seamlessly integrates single-pass reasoning with iterative memory-based processing for tasks exceeding 4M tokens. Based on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, QwenLong-L1.5 achieves performance comparable to GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro on long-context reasoning benchmarks, surpassing its baseline by 9.90 points on average. On ultra-long tasks (1M~4M tokens), QwenLong-L1.5's memory-agent framework yields a 9.48-point gain over the agent baseline. Additionally, the acquired long-context reasoning ability translates to enhanced performance in general domains like scientific reasoning, memory tool using, and extended dialogue.

   title: Adaptation of Agentic AI
   summary: Cutting-edge agentic AI systems are built on foundation models that can be adapted to plan, reason, and interact with external tools to perform increasingly complex and specialized tasks. As these systems grow in capability and scope, adaptation becomes a central mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. In this paper, we unify the rapidly expanding research landscape into a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations. We further decompose these into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms of agent adaptation, as well as agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms of tool adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities. Overall, this paper aims to offer a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to build more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems.

   title: Towards Scalable Pre-training of Visual Tokenizers for Generation
   summary: The quality of the latent space in visual tokenizers (e.g., VAEs) is crucial for modern generative models. However, the standard reconstruction-based training paradigm produces a latent space that is biased towards low-level information, leading to a foundation flaw: better pixel-level accuracy does not lead to higher-quality generation. This implies that pouring extensive compute into visual tokenizer pre-training translates poorly to improved performance in generation. We identify this as the ``pre-training scaling problem`` and suggest a necessary shift: to be effective for generation, a latent space must concisely represent high-level semantics. We present VTP, a unified visual tokenizer pre-training framework, pioneering the joint optimization of image-text contrastive, self-supervised, and reconstruction losses. Our large-scale study reveals two principal findings: (1) understanding is a key driver of generation, and (2) much better scaling properties, where generative performance scales effectively with compute, parameters, and data allocated to the pretraining of the visual tokenizer. After large-scale pre-training, our tokenizer delivers a competitive profile (78.2 zero-shot accuracy and 0.36 rFID on ImageNet) and 4.1 times faster convergence on generation compared to advanced distillation methods. More importantly, it scales effectively: without modifying standard DiT training specs, solely investing more FLOPS in pretraining VTP achieves 65.8\% FID improvement in downstream generation, while conventional autoencoder stagnates very early at 1/10 FLOPS. Our pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/VTP.

   title: Stabilizing Reinforcement Learning with LLMs: Formulation and Practices
   summary: This paper proposes a novel formulation for reinforcement learning (RL) with large language models, explaining why and under what conditions the true sequence-level reward can be optimized via a surrogate token-level objective in policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE. Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization. We hope that the shared insights and the developed recipes for stable RL training will facilitate future research.

   title: InsertAnywhere: Bridging 4D Scene Geometry and Diffusion Models for Realistic Video Object Insertion
   summary: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have opened new possibilities for controllable video editing, yet realistic video object insertion (VOI) remains challenging due to limited 4D scene understanding and inadequate handling of occlusion and lighting effects. We present InsertAnywhere, a new VOI framework that achieves geometrically consistent object placement and appearance-faithful video synthesis. Our method begins with a 4D aware mask generation module that reconstructs the scene geometry and propagates user specified object placement across frames while maintaining temporal coherence and occlusion consistency. Building upon this spatial foundation, we extend a diffusion based video generation model to jointly synthesize the inserted object and its surrounding local variations such as illumination and shading. To enable supervised training, we introduce ROSE++, an illumination aware synthetic dataset constructed by transforming the ROSE object removal dataset into triplets of object removed video, object present video, and a VLM generated reference image. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework produces geometrically plausible and visually coherent object insertions across diverse real world scenarios, significantly outperforming existing research and commercial models.

   title: Coupling Experts and Routers in Mixture-of-Experts via an Auxiliary Loss
   summary: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models lack explicit constraints to ensure the router's decisions align well with the experts' capabilities, which ultimately limits model performance. To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs.

   title: TurboDiffusion: Accelerating Video Diffusion Models by 100-200 Times
   summary: We introduce TurboDiffusion, a video generation acceleration framework that can speed up end-to-end diffusion generation by 100-200x while maintaining video quality. TurboDiffusion mainly relies on several components for acceleration: (1) Attention acceleration: TurboDiffusion uses low-bit SageAttention and trainable Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) to speed up attention computation. (2) Step distillation: TurboDiffusion adopts rCM for efficient step distillation. (3) W8A8 quantization: TurboDiffusion quantizes model parameters and activations to 8 bits to accelerate linear layers and compress the model. In addition, TurboDiffusion incorporates several other engineering optimizations.
  We conduct experiments on the Wan2.2-I2V-14B-720P, Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-480P, Wan2.1-T2V-14B-720P, and Wan2.1-T2V-14B-480P models. Experimental results show that TurboDiffusion achieves 100-200x speedup for video generation even on a single RTX 5090 GPU, while maintaining comparable video quality. The GitHub repository, which includes model checkpoints and easy-to-use code, is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/TurboDiffusion.

   title: SemanticGen: Video Generation in Semantic Space
   summary: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.
   id: 2512.20619
   ai_summary: SemanticGen addresses slow convergence and computational costs in video generation by using a two-stage diffusion model approach that first generates semantic features and then VAE latents, leading to faster convergence and high-quality results.

   title: ReFusion: A Diffusion Large Language Model with Parallel Autoregressive Decoding
   summary: Autoregressive models (ARMs) are hindered by slow sequential inference. While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18times speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33times average speedup.

   title: Envision: Benchmarking Unified Understanding & Generation for Causal World Process Insights
   summary: Current multimodal models aim to transcend the limitations of single-modality representations by unifying understanding and generation, often using text-to-image (T2I) tasks to calibrate semantic consistency. However, their reliance on static, single-image generation in training and evaluation leads to overfitting to static pattern matching and semantic fusion, while fundamentally hindering their ability to model dynamic processes that unfold over time. To address these constraints, we propose Envision-a causal event progression benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation. Grounded in world knowledge and structured by spatiotemporal causality, it reorganizes existing evaluation dimensions and includes 1,000 four-stage prompts spanning six scientific and humanities domains. To transition evaluation from single images to sequential frames and assess whether models truly internalize world knowledge while adhering to causal-temporal constraints, we introduce Envision-Score, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional consistency, physicality, and aesthetics. Comprehensive evaluation of 15 models (10 specialized T2I models, 5 unified models) uncovers: specialized T2I models demonstrate proficiency in aesthetic rendering yet lack intrinsic world knowledge. Unified multimodal models bridge this gap, consistently outperforming specialized counterparts in causal narrative coherence. However, even these unified architectures remain subordinate to closed-source models and struggle to overcome the core challenge of spatiotemporal consistency. This demonstrates that a focus on causally-isolated single images impedes multi-frame reasoning and generation, promoting static pattern matching over dynamic world modeling-ultimately limiting world knowledge internalization, generation.

   ai_summary: A benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation assesses models' ability to model dynamic causal processes and world knowledge, revealing that unified multimodal models outperform specialized ones but still struggle with spatiotemporal consistency.

   title: DeepSeekMath-V2: Towards Self-Verifiable Mathematical Reasoning
   summary: Large language models have made significant progress in mathematical reasoning, which serves as an important testbed for AI and could impact scientific research if further advanced. By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute.

   title: Next-Embedding Prediction Makes Strong Vision Learners
   summary: Inspired by the success of generative pretraining in natural language, we ask whether the same principles can yield strong self-supervised visual learners. Instead of training models to output features for downstream use, we train them to generate embeddings to perform predictive tasks directly. This work explores such a shift from learning representations to learning models. Specifically, models learn to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones, using causal masking and stop gradient, which we refer to as Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA). We demonstrate that a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as its sole learning objective is effective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads. This formulation retains architectural simplicity and scalability, without requiring additional design complexity. NEPA achieves strong results across tasks, attaining 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transferring effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K. We believe generative pretraining from embeddings provides a simple, scalable, and potentially modality-agnostic alternative to visual self-supervised learning.

   title: Step-DeepResearch Technical Report
   summary: As LLMs shift toward autonomous agents, Deep Research has emerged as a pivotal metric. However, existing academic benchmarks like BrowseComp often fail to meet real-world demands for open-ended research, which requires robust skills in intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduce Step-DeepResearch, a cost-effective, end-to-end agent. We propose a Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities to reinforce planning and report writing, combined with a progressive training path from agentic mid-training to SFT and RL. Enhanced by a Checklist-style Judger, this approach significantly improves robustness. Furthermore, to bridge the evaluation gap in the Chinese domain, we establish ADR-Bench for realistic deep research scenarios. Experimental results show that Step-DeepResearch (32B) scores 61.4% on Scale AI Research Rubrics. On ADR-Bench, it significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals SOTA closed-source models like OpenAI and Gemini DeepResearch. These findings prove that refined training enables medium-sized models to achieve expert-level capabilities at industry-leading cost-efficiency.

   summary: This paper presents LLaDA2.0 -- a tuple of discrete diffusion large language models (dLLM) scaling up to 100B total parameters through systematic conversion from auto-regressive (AR) models -- establishing a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment. Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.

   title: Nex-N1: Agentic Models Trained via a Unified Ecosystem for Large-Scale Environment Construction
   summary: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive responders to autonomous agents necessitates a fundamental shift in learning paradigms -- from static imitation to incentive-driven decision making. However, this transition is significantly impeded by the lack of scalable infrastructure capable of constructing high-quality interaction signals for effective policy learning. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive method designed to systematically scale the diversity and complexity of interactive environments. Our method realizes this scaling by addressing three orthogonal dimensions: (1) Complexity: NexAU, a flexible agent framework that supports building complex agent hierarchies via simple configurations; (2) Diversity: NexA4A automatically generates diverse agent hierarchies from natural language to cover infinite domains; and (3) Fidelity: NexGAP bridges the simulation-reality gap by integrating dynamic real-world environment for grounded trajectories synthesis. We train Nex-N1 upon the diverse and complex interactive environments established by our infrastructure. Empirical results on benchmarks such as SWE-bench and tau2 demonstrate that Nex-N1 consistently outperforms SOTA open-source models and achieves competitive performance against frontier proprietary models on complex agentic tasks. We open-source the Nex ecosystem and model weights to facilitate further research.

   title: Native Parallel Reasoner: Reasoning in Parallelism via Self-Distilled Reinforcement Learning
   summary: We introduce Native Parallel Reasoner (NPR), a teacher-free framework that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-evolve genuine parallel reasoning capabilities. NPR transforms the model from sequential emulation to native parallel cognition through three key innovations: 1) a self-distilled progressive training paradigm that transitions from ``cold-start'' format discovery to strict topological constraints without external supervision; 2) a novel Parallel-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO) algorithm that optimizes branching policies directly within the execution graph, allowing the model to learn adaptive decomposition via trial and error; and 3) a robust NPR Engine that refactors memory management and flow control of SGLang to enable stable, large-scale parallel RL training. Across eight reasoning benchmarks, NPR trained on Qwen3-4B achieves performance gains of up to 24.5% and inference speedups up to 4.6x. Unlike prior baselines that often fall back to autoregressive decoding, NPR demonstrates 100% genuine parallel execution, establishing a new standard for self-evolving, efficient, and scalable agentic reasoning.

   title: TwinFlow: Realizing One-step Generation on Large Models with Self-adversarial Flows
   summary: Recent advances in large multi-modal generative models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multi-modal generation, including image and video generation. These models are typically built upon multi-step frameworks like diffusion and flow matching, which inherently limits their inference efficiency (requiring 40-100 Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs)). While various few-step methods aim to accelerate the inference, existing solutions have clear limitations. Prominent distillation-based methods, such as progressive and consistency distillation, either require an iterative distillation procedure or show significant degradation at very few steps (< 4-NFE). Meanwhile, integrating adversarial training into distillation (e.g., DMD/DMD2 and SANA-Sprint) to enhance performance introduces training instability, added complexity, and high GPU memory overhead due to the auxiliary trained models. To this end, we propose TwinFlow, a simple yet effective framework for training 1-step generative models that bypasses the need of fixed pretrained teacher models and avoids standard adversarial networks during training, making it ideal for building large-scale, efficient models. On text-to-image tasks, our method achieves a GenEval score of 0.83 in 1-NFE, outperforming strong baselines like SANA-Sprint (a GAN loss-based framework) and RCGM (a consistency-based framework). Notably, we demonstrate the scalability of TwinFlow by full-parameter training on Qwen-Image-20B and transform it into an efficient few-step generator. With just 1-NFE, our approach matches the performance of the original 100-NFE model on both the GenEval and DPG-Bench benchmarks, reducing computational cost by 100times with minor quality degradation.

   title: LongVie 2: Multimodal Controllable Ultra-Long Video World Model
   summary: Building video world models upon pretrained video generation systems represents an important yet challenging step toward general spatiotemporal intelligence. A world model should possess three essential properties: controllability, long-term visual quality, and temporal consistency. To this end, we take a progressive approach-first enhancing controllability and then extending toward long-term, high-quality generation. We present LongVie 2, an end-to-end autoregressive framework trained in three stages: (1) Multi-modal guidance, which integrates dense and sparse control signals to provide implicit world-level supervision and improve controllability; (2) Degradation-aware training on the input frame, bridging the gap between training and long-term inference to maintain high visual quality; and (3) History-context guidance, which aligns contextual information across adjacent clips to ensure temporal consistency. We further introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 100 high-resolution one-minute videos covering diverse real-world and synthetic environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LongVie 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, temporal coherence, and visual fidelity, and supports continuous video generation lasting up to five minutes, marking a significant step toward unified video world modeling.

   title: PhysBrain: Human Egocentric Data as a Bridge from Vision Language Models to Physical Intelligence
   summary: Robotic generalization relies on physical intelligence: the ability to reason about state changes, contact-rich interactions, and long-horizon planning under egocentric perception and action. However, most VLMs are trained primarily on third-person data, creating a fundamental viewpoint mismatch for humanoid robots. Scaling robot egocentric data collection remains impractical due to high cost and limited diversity, whereas large-scale human egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative that naturally capture rich interaction context and causal structure. The key challenge is to convert raw egocentric videos into structured and reliable embodiment training supervision. Accordingly, we propose an Egocentric2Embodiment translation pipeline that transforms first-person videos into multi-level, schema-driven VQA supervision with enforced evidence grounding and temporal consistency, enabling the construction of the Egocentric2Embodiment dataset (E2E-3M) at scale. An egocentric-aware embodied brain, termed PhysBrain, is obtained by training on the E2E-3M dataset. PhysBrain exhibits substantially improved egocentric understanding, particularly for planning on EgoThink. It provides an egocentric-aware initialization that enables more sample-efficient VLA fine-tuning and higher SimplerEnv success rates (53.9\%), demonstrating effective transfer from human egocentric supervision to downstream robot control.

   title: TUNA: Taming Unified Visual Representations for Native Unified Multimodal Models
   summary: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) aim to jointly perform multimodal understanding and generation within a single framework. We present TUNA, a native UMM that builds a unified continuous visual representation by cascading a VAE encoder with a representation encoder. This unified representation space allows end-to-end processing of images and videos for both understanding and generation tasks. Compared to prior UMMs with decoupled representations, TUNA's unified visual space avoids representation format mismatches introduced by separate encoders, outperforming decoupled alternatives in both understanding and generation. Moreover, we observe that stronger pretrained representation encoders consistently yield better performance across all multimodal tasks, highlighting the importance of the representation encoder. Finally, in this unified setting, jointly training on both understanding and generation data allows the two tasks to benefit from each other rather than interfere. Our extensive experiments on multimodal understanding and generation benchmarks show that TUNA achieves state-of-the-art results in image and video understanding, image and video generation, and image editing, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of its unified representation design.

   title: StereoWorld: Geometry-Aware Monocular-to-Stereo Video Generation
   summary: The growing adoption of XR devices has fueled strong demand for high-quality stereo video, yet its production remains costly and artifact-prone. To address this challenge, we present StereoWorld, an end-to-end framework that repurposes a pretrained video generator for high-fidelity monocular-to-stereo video generation. Our framework jointly conditions the model on the monocular video input while explicitly supervising the generation with a geometry-aware regularization to ensure 3D structural fidelity. A spatio-temporal tiling scheme is further integrated to enable efficient, high-resolution synthesis. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate a high-definition stereo video dataset containing over 11M frames aligned to natural human interpupillary distance (IPD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that StereoWorld substantially outperforms prior methods, generating stereo videos with superior visual fidelity and geometric consistency.

   title: PaperDebugger: A Plugin-Based Multi-Agent System for In-Editor Academic Writing, Review, and Editing
   summary: Large language models are increasingly embedded into academic writing workflows, yet existing assistants remain external to the editor, preventing deep interaction with document state, structure, and revision history. This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors such as Overleaf. We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor, multi-agent, and plugin-based academic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant. More details about this demo and video could be found at https://github.com/PaperDebugger/PaperDebugger.

   title: Deep Research: A Systematic Survey
   summary: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from text generators into powerful problem solvers. Yet, many open tasks demand critical thinking, multi-source, and verifiable outputs, which are beyond single-shot prompting or standard retrieval-augmented generation. Recently, numerous studies have explored Deep Research (DR), which aims to combine the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with external tools, such as search engines, thereby empowering LLMs to act as research agents capable of completing complex, open-ended tasks. This survey presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of deep research systems, including a clear roadmap, foundational components, practical implementation techniques, important challenges, and future directions. Specifically, our main contributions are as follows: (i) we formalize a three-stage roadmap and distinguish deep research from related paradigms; (ii) we introduce four key components: query planning, information acquisition, memory management, and answer generation, each paired with fine-grained sub-taxonomies; (iii) we summarize optimization techniques, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning; and (iv) we consolidate evaluation criteria and open challenges, aiming to guide and facilitate future development. As the field of deep research continues to evolve rapidly, we are committed to continuously updating this survey to reflect the latest progress in this area.

   title: WorldPlay: Towards Long-Term Geometric Consistency for Real-Time Interactive World Modeling
   summary: This paper presents WorldPlay, a streaming video diffusion model that enables real-time, interactive world modeling with long-term geometric consistency, resolving the trade-off between speed and memory that limits current methods. WorldPlay draws power from three key innovations. 1) We use a Dual Action Representation to enable robust action control in response to the user's keyboard and mouse inputs. 2) To enforce long-term consistency, our Reconstituted Context Memory dynamically rebuilds context from past frames and uses temporal reframing to keep geometrically important but long-past frames accessible, effectively alleviating memory attenuation. 3) We also propose Context Forcing, a novel distillation method designed for memory-aware model. Aligning memory context between the teacher and student preserves the student's capacity to use long-range information, enabling real-time speeds while preventing error drift. Taken together, WorldPlay generates long-horizon streaming 720p video at 24 FPS with superior consistency, comparing favorably with existing techniques and showing strong generalization across diverse scenes.

   title: Robust-R1: Degradation-Aware Reasoning for Robust Visual Understanding
   summary: Multimodal Large Language Models struggle to maintain reliable performance under extreme real-world visual degradations, which impede their practical robustness. Existing robust MLLMs predominantly rely on implicit training/adaptation that focuses solely on visual encoder generalization, suffering from limited interpretability and isolated optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust-R1, a novel framework that explicitly models visual degradations through structured reasoning chains. Our approach integrates: (i) supervised fine-tuning for degradation-aware reasoning foundations, (ii) reward-driven alignment for accurately perceiving degradation parameters, and (iii) dynamic reasoning depth scaling adapted to degradation intensity. To facilitate this approach, we introduce a specialized 11K dataset featuring realistic degradations synthesized across four critical real-world visual processing stages, each annotated with structured chains connecting degradation parameters, perceptual influence, pristine semantic reasoning chain, and conclusion. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness: Robust-R1 outperforms all general and robust baselines on the real-world degradation benchmark R-Bench, while maintaining superior anti-degradation performance under multi-intensity adversarial degradations on MMMB, MMStar, and RealWorldQA.

   title: LiveTalk: Real-Time Multimodal Interactive Video Diffusion via Improved On-Policy Distillation
   summary: Real-time video generation via diffusion is essential for building general-purpose multimodal interactive AI systems. However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.

   title: Video Reality Test: Can AI-Generated ASMR Videos fool VLMs and Humans?
   summary: Recent advances in video generation have produced vivid content that are often indistinguishable from real videos, making AI-generated video detection an emerging societal challenge. Prior AIGC detection benchmarks mostly evaluate video without audio, target broad narrative domains, and focus on classification solely. Yet it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art video generation models can produce immersive, audio-paired videos that reliably deceive humans and VLMs. To this end, we introduce Video Reality Test, an ASMR-sourced video benchmark suite for testing perceptual realism under tight audio-visual coupling, featuring the following dimensions: (i) Immersive ASMR video-audio sources. Built on carefully curated real ASMR videos, the benchmark targets fine-grained action-object interactions with diversity across objects, actions, and backgrounds. (ii) Peer-Review evaluation. An adversarial creator-reviewer protocol where video generation models act as creators aiming to fool reviewers, while VLMs serve as reviewers seeking to identify fakeness. Our experimental findings show: The best creator Veo3.1-Fast even fools most VLMs: the strongest reviewer (Gemini 2.5-Pro) achieves only 56\% accuracy (random 50\%), far below that of human experts (81.25\%). Adding audio improves real-fake discrimination, yet superficial cues such as watermarks can still significantly mislead models. These findings delineate the current boundary of video generation realism and expose limitations of VLMs in perceptual fidelity and audio-visual consistency. Our code is available at https://github.com/video-reality-test/video-reality-test.

   title: The Prism Hypothesis: Harmonizing Semantic and Pixel Representations via Unified Autoencoding
   summary: Deep representations across modalities are inherently intertwined. In this paper, we systematically analyze the spectral characteristics of various semantic and pixel encoders. Interestingly, our study uncovers a highly inspiring and rarely explored correspondence between an encoder's feature spectrum and its functional role: semantic encoders primarily capture low-frequency components that encode abstract meaning, whereas pixel encoders additionally retain high-frequency information that conveys fine-grained detail. This heuristic finding offers a unifying perspective that ties encoder behavior to its underlying spectral structure. We define it as the Prism Hypothesis, where each data modality can be viewed as a projection of the natural world onto a shared feature spectrum, just like the prism. Building on this insight, we propose Unified Autoencoding (UAE), a model that harmonizes semantic structure and pixel details via an innovative frequency-band modulator, enabling their seamless coexistence. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and MS-COCO benchmarks validate that our UAE effectively unifies semantic abstraction and pixel-level fidelity into a single latent space with state-of-the-art performance.

   title: MultiShotMaster: A Controllable Multi-Shot Video Generation Framework
   summary: Current video generation techniques excel at single-shot clips but struggle to produce narrative multi-shot videos, which require flexible shot arrangement, coherent narrative, and controllability beyond text prompts. To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiShotMaster, a framework for highly controllable multi-shot video generation. We extend a pretrained single-shot model by integrating two novel variants of RoPE. First, we introduce Multi-Shot Narrative RoPE, which applies explicit phase shift at shot transitions, enabling flexible shot arrangement while preserving the temporal narrative order. Second, we design Spatiotemporal Position-Aware RoPE to incorporate reference tokens and grounding signals, enabling spatiotemporal-grounded reference injection. In addition, to overcome data scarcity, we establish an automated data annotation pipeline to extract multi-shot videos, captions, cross-shot grounding signals and reference images. Our framework leverages the intrinsic architectural properties to support multi-shot video generation, featuring text-driven inter-shot consistency, customized subject with motion control, and background-driven customized scene. Both shot count and duration are flexibly configurable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and outstanding controllability of our framework.

   title: Bottom-up Policy Optimization: Your Language Model Policy Secretly Contains Internal Policies
   summary: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches treat large language models (LLMs) as a single unified policy, overlooking their internal mechanisms. Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training. By aligning training objective at lower layer, BuPO reconstructs foundational reasoning capabilities and achieves superior performance. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/BuPO.

   title: Qwen-Image-Layered: Towards Inherent Editability via Layer Decomposition
   summary: Recent visual generative models often struggle with consistency during image editing due to the entangled nature of raster images, where all visual content is fused into a single canvas. In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency. Motivated by this, we propose Qwen-Image-Layered, an end-to-end diffusion model that decomposes a single RGB image into multiple semantically disentangled RGBA layers, enabling inherent editability, where each RGBA layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content. To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) an RGBA-VAE to unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) a VLD-MMDiT (Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) a Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of high-quality multilayer training images, we build a pipeline to extract and annotate multilayer images from Photoshop documents (PSD). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing. Our code and models are released on https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Image-Layered{https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Image-Layered}

   title: Emergent temporal abstractions in autoregressive models enable hierarchical reinforcement learning
   summary: Large-scale autoregressive models pretrained on next-token prediction and finetuned with reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved unprecedented success on many problem domains. During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term "internal RL", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.
