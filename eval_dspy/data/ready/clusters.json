        "title": "2.5 Years in Class: A Multimodal Textbook for Vision-Language\n  Pretraining",
        "summary": "Compared to image-text pair data, interleaved corpora enable Vision-Language\nModels (VLMs) to understand the world more naturally like humans. However, such\nexisting datasets are crawled from webpage, facing challenges like low\nknowledge density, loose image-text relations, and poor logical coherence\nbetween images. On the other hand, the internet hosts vast instructional videos\n(e.g., online geometry courses) that are widely used by humans to learn\nfoundational subjects, yet these valuable resources remain underexplored in VLM\ntraining. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality multimodal\ntextbook corpus with richer foundational knowledge for VLM pretraining. It\ncollects over 2.5 years of instructional videos, totaling 22,000 class hours.\nWe first use an LLM-proposed taxonomy to systematically gather instructional\nvideos. Then we progressively extract and refine visual (keyframes), audio\n(ASR), and textual knowledge (OCR) from the videos, and organize as an\nimage-text interleaved corpus based on temporal order. Compared to its\ncounterparts, our video-centric textbook offers more coherent context, richer\nknowledge, and better image-text alignment. Experiments demonstrate its superb\npretraining performance, particularly in knowledge- and reasoning-intensive\ntasks like ScienceQA and MathVista. Moreover, VLMs pre-trained on our textbook\nexhibit outstanding interleaved context awareness, leveraging visual and\ntextual cues in their few-shot context for task solving~Our code are\navailable at \\url{https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/multimodal_textbook}.",

        "summary": "In this paper, we propose VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced multimodal foundation\nmodel for image and video understanding. The core design philosophy of\nVideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of \"vision-centric\" is two-fold: the\nvision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key\ninsight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text\ndata is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing\nmassive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and\nhigh-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1)\nvision-centric alignment stage, which warms up the vision encoder and\nprojector; 2) vision-language pretraining stage, which jointly tunes the vision\nencoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data covering multiple\ntypes (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as text-only data. 3)\nmulti-task fine-tuning stage, which incorporates image-text SFT data for\ndownstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for video\nunderstanding. 4) video-centric fine-tuning, which further improves the model's\ncapability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to better\ncapture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is\nadapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding\nnumbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the\nnumber of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the\nrepresentation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from\nvision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both\nimage and video understanding benchmarks.",

        "title": "LlamaV-o1: Rethinking Step-by-step Visual Reasoning in LLMs",
        "summary": "Reasoning is a fundamental capability for solving complex multi-step\nproblems, particularly in visual contexts where sequential step-wise\nunderstanding is essential. Existing approaches lack a comprehensive framework\nfor evaluating visual reasoning and do not emphasize step-wise problem-solving.\nTo this end, we propose a comprehensive framework for advancing step-by-step\nvisual reasoning in large language models (LMMs) through three key\ncontributions. First, we introduce a visual reasoning benchmark specifically\ndesigned to evaluate multi-step reasoning tasks. The benchmark presents a\ndiverse set of challenges with eight different categories ranging from complex\nvisual perception to scientific reasoning with over 4k reasoning steps in\ntotal, enabling robust evaluation of LLMs' abilities to perform accurate and\ninterpretable visual reasoning across multiple steps. Second, we propose a\nnovel metric that assesses visual reasoning quality at the granularity of\nindividual steps, emphasizing both correctness and logical coherence. The\nproposed metric offers deeper insights into reasoning performance compared to\ntraditional end-task accuracy metrics. Third, we present a new multimodal\nvisual reasoning model, named LlamaV-o1, trained using a multi-step curriculum\nlearning approach, where tasks are progressively organized to facilitate\nincremental skill acquisition and problem-solving. The proposed LlamaV-o1 is\ndesigned for multi-step reasoning and learns step-by-step through a structured\ntraining paradigm. Extensive experiments show that our LlamaV-o1 outperforms\nexisting open-source models and performs favorably against close-source\nproprietary models. Compared to the recent Llava-CoT, our LlamaV-o1 achieves an\naverage score of 67.3 with an absolute gain of 3.8\\% across six benchmarks\nwhile being 5 times faster during inference scaling. Our benchmark, model, and\ncode are publicly available.",

        "title": "LLaVA-Mini: Efficient Image and Video Large Multimodal Models with One\n  Vision Token",
        "summary": "The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has\nsparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs. LMM frameworks typically\nencode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and\nintegrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language\nmodels (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens\n(predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead.\nPrevious efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM\nbackbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token\nquantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal\nvision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while\npreserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision\ntokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early\nlayers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text\ntokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to\nfuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the\nextreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token.\nLLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the\nunderstanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient\nmanner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks\ndemonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token\ninstead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by\n77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over\n10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory.",

MMVU includes 3,000\nexpert-annotated questions spanning 27 subjects across four core disciplines:\nScience, Healthcare, Humanities & Social Sciences, and Engineering.

        "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful strategy to address the\nissue of generating factually incorrect outputs in foundation models by\nretrieving external knowledge relevant to queries and incorporating it into\ntheir generation process. However, existing RAG approaches have primarily\nfocused on textual information, with some recent advancements beginning to\nconsider images, and they largely overlook videos, a rich source of multimodal\nknowledge capable of representing events, processes, and contextual details\nmore effectively than any other modality. While a few recent studies explore\nthe integration of videos in the response generation process, they either\npredefine query-associated videos without retrieving them according to queries,\nor convert videos into the textual descriptions without harnessing their\nmultimodal richness. To tackle these, we introduce VideoRAG, a novel framework\nthat not only dynamically retrieves relevant videos based on their relevance\nwith queries but also utilizes both visual and textual information of videos in\nthe output generation. Further, to operationalize this, our method revolves\naround the recent advance of Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), which enable\nthe direct processing of video content to represent it for retrieval and\nseamless integration of the retrieved videos jointly with queries. We\nexperimentally validate the effectiveness of VideoRAG, showcasing that it is\nsuperior to relevant baselines.",

        "summary": "The development of general robotic systems capable of manipulating in\nunstructured environments is a significant challenge. While Vision-Language\nModels(VLM) excel in high-level commonsense reasoning, they lack the\nfine-grained 3D spatial understanding required for precise manipulation tasks.\nFine-tuning VLM on robotic datasets to create Vision-Language-Action\nModels(VLA) is a potential solution, but it is hindered by high data collection\ncosts and generalization issues. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel object-centric representation that bridges the gap between VLM's\nhigh-level reasoning and the low-level precision required for manipulation. Our\nkey insight is that an object's canonical space, defined by its functional\naffordances, provides a structured and semantically meaningful way to describe\ninteraction primitives, such as points and directions. These primitives act as\na bridge, translating VLM's commonsense reasoning into actionable 3D spatial\nconstraints. In this context, we introduce a dual closed-loop, open-vocabulary\nrobotic manipulation system: one loop for high-level planning through primitive\nresampling, interaction rendering and VLM checking, and another for low-level\nexecution via 6D pose tracking. This design ensures robust, real-time control\nwithout requiring VLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong\nzero-shot generalization across diverse robotic manipulation tasks,\nhighlighting the potential of this approach for automating large-scale\nsimulation data generation.",

Starting from a text-to-video\nmodel, we utilize an ID extractor to inject the global identity and leverage a\nbox sequence to control the overall motion. To preserve the detailed appearance\nand meanwhile support fine-grained motion control, we design a pixel warper. It\ntakes the reference image with arbitrary key-points and the corresponding\nkey-point trajectories as inputs. It warps the pixel details according to the\ntrajectories and fuses the warped features with the diffusion U-Net, thus\nimproving detail preservation and supporting users in manipulating the motion\ntrajectories. In addition, we propose a training strategy involving both videos\nand static images with a reweight reconstruction loss to enhance insertion\nquality.

CodeElo\nbenchmark is mainly based on the official CodeForces platform and tries to\nalign with the platform as much as possible. We compile the recent six months\nof contest problems on CodeForces with detailed information such as contest\ndivisions, problem difficulty ratings, and problem algorithm tags. We introduce\na unique judging method in which problems are submitted directly to the\nplatform and develop a reliable Elo rating calculation system that aligns with\nthe platform and is comparable with human participants but has lower variance.\nBy testing on our CodeElo, we provide the Elo ratings of 30 existing popular\nopen-source and 3 proprietary LLMs for the first time. The results show that\no1-mini and QwQ-32B-Preview stand out significantly, achieving Elo ratings of\n1578 and 1261, respectively, while other models struggle even with the easiest\nproblems, placing in the lowest 20 percent among all human participants.\nDetailed analysis experiments are also conducted to provide insights into\nperformance across algorithms and comparisons between using C++ and Python,\nwhich can suggest directions for future studies.",

Conventional RAG methods usually perform a single retrieval\nstep before the generation process, which limits their effectiveness in\naddressing complex queries due to imperfect retrieval results. In contrast, our\nproposed method, CoRAG (Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation), allows the\nmodel to dynamically reformulate the query based on the evolving state. To\ntrain CoRAG effectively, we utilize rejection sampling to automatically\ngenerate intermediate retrieval chains, thereby augmenting existing RAG\ndatasets that only provide the correct final answer. At test time, we propose\nvarious decoding strategies to scale the model's test-time compute by\ncontrolling the length and number of sampled retrieval chains. Experimental\nresults across multiple benchmarks validate the efficacy of CoRAG, particularly\nin multi-hop question answering tasks, where we observe more than 10 points\nimprovement in EM score compared to strong baselines. On the KILT benchmark,\nCoRAG establishes a new state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of\nknowledge-intensive tasks.

        "summary": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs) have demonstrated human-like computer control capability. Despite their\nutility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists:\ncollecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for\ncollecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation\nthrough executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or\nunable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited\ndata diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world\nenvironments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI\ndata synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection\nprocess. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents\nfirst to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then\nretrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level\nexploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality\nof the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with\nOS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging\nonline benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency\nand its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis\nmethods.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) agents are increasingly pivotal for addressing\ncomplex tasks in interactive environments. Existing work mainly focuses on\nenhancing performance through behavior cloning from stronger experts, yet such\napproaches often falter in real-world applications, mainly due to the inability\nto recover from errors. However, step-level critique data is difficult and\nexpensive to collect. Automating and dynamically constructing self-critique\ndatasets is thus crucial to empowering models with intelligent agent\ncapabilities. In this work, we propose an iterative self-training framework,\nAgent-R, that enables language Agent to Reflect on the fly. Unlike traditional\nmethods that reward or penalize actions based on correctness, Agent-R leverages\nMCTS to construct training data that recover correct trajectories from\nerroneous ones. A key challenge of agent reflection lies in the necessity for\ntimely revision rather than waiting until the end of a rollout. To address\nthis, we introduce a model-guided critique construction mechanism: the actor\nmodel identifies the first error step (within its current capability) in a\nfailed trajectory. Starting from it, we splice it with the adjacent correct\npath, which shares the same parent node in the tree. This strategy enables the\nmodel to learn reflection based on its current policy, therefore yielding\nbetter learning efficiency. To further explore the scalability of this\nself-improvement paradigm, we investigate iterative refinement of both error\ncorrection capabilities and dataset construction. Our findings demonstrate that\nAgent-R continuously improves the model's ability to recover from errors and\nenables timely error correction. Experiments on three interactive environments\nshow that Agent-R effectively equips agents to correct erroneous actions while\navoiding loops, achieving superior performance compared to baseline methods\n(+5.59%).",

In this\nwork, we introduce Test-time Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that\naligns LLM outputs with human preferences during inference, removing the need\nto update model parameters. Rather than relying on purely numerical rewards,\nTPO translates reward signals into textual critiques and uses them as textual\nrewards to iteratively refine its response.

        "summary": "Process Reward Models (PRMs) emerge as a promising approach for process\nsupervision in mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), which\naim to identify and mitigate intermediate errors in the reasoning processes.\nHowever, the development of effective PRMs faces significant challenges,\nparticularly in data annotation and evaluation methodologies. In this paper,\nthrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate that commonly used Monte Carlo\n(MC) estimation-based data synthesis for PRMs typically yields inferior\nperformance and generalization compared to LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation\nmethods. MC estimation relies on completion models to evaluate current-step\ncorrectness, leading to inaccurate step verification. Furthermore, we identify\npotential biases in conventional Best-of-N (BoN) evaluation strategies for\nPRMs: (1) The unreliable policy models generate responses with correct answers\nbut flawed processes, leading to a misalignment between the evaluation criteria\nof BoN and the PRM objectives of process verification. (2) The tolerance of\nPRMs of such responses leads to inflated BoN scores. (3) Existing PRMs have a\nsignificant proportion of minimum scores concentrated on the final answer\nsteps, revealing the shift from process to outcome-based assessment in BoN\nOptimized PRMs. To address these challenges, we develop a consensus filtering\nmechanism that effectively integrates MC estimation with LLM-as-a-judge and\nadvocates a more comprehensive evaluation framework that combines\nresponse-level and step-level metrics. Based on the mechanisms, we\nsignificantly improve both model performance and data efficiency in the BoN\nevaluation and the step-wise error identification task. Finally, we release a\nnew state-of-the-art PRM that outperforms existing open-source alternatives and\nprovides practical guidelines for future research in building process\nsupervision models.",

        "summary": "This paper revisits the implementation of\nLoad-balancing Loss (LBL) when training\nMixture-of-Experts (MoEs) models. Specifically, LBL for MoEs is defined as N_E\nsum_{i=1}^{N_E} f_i p_i, where N_E is the total number of experts, f_i\nrepresents the frequency of expert i being selected, and p_i denotes the\naverage gating score of the expert i. Existing MoE training frameworks\nusually employ the parallel training strategy so that f_i and the LBL are\ncalculated within a micro-batch and then averaged across parallel\ngroups. In essence, a micro-batch for training billion-scale LLMs normally\ncontains very few sequences. So, the micro-batch LBL is almost at the sequence\nlevel, and the router is pushed to distribute the token evenly within each\nsequence. Under this strict constraint, even tokens from a domain-specific\nsequence (e.g., code) are uniformly routed to all experts, thereby\ninhibiting expert specialization. In this work, we propose calculating LBL\nusing a global-batch to loose this constraint. Because a\nglobal-batch contains much more diverse sequences than a micro-batch, which\nwill encourage load balance at the corpus level. Specifically, we introduce an\nextra communication step to synchronize f_i across micro-batches and then use\nit to calculate the LBL. Through experiments on training MoEs-based LLMs (up to\n42.8B total parameters and 400B tokens), we surprisingly\nfind that the global-batch LBL strategy yields excellent performance gains in\nboth pre-training perplexity and downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals that\nthe global-batch LBL also greatly improves the domain specialization of MoE\nexperts.",

One of the principal challenges in MARL is the need for explicit\nprediction of the agents' behavior to achieve cooperation. To resolve this\nissue, we propose the Shared Recurrent Memory Transformer (SRMT) which extends\nmemory transformers to multi-agent settings by pooling and globally\nbroadcasting individual working memories, enabling agents to exchange\ninformation implicitly and coordinate their actions.

In this work, we introduce MinMo, a Multimodal\nLarge Language Model with approximately 8B parameters for seamless voice\ninteraction. We address the main limitations of prior aligned multimodal\nmodels. We train MinMo through multiple stages of speech-to-text alignment,\ntext-to-speech alignment, speech-to-speech alignment, and duplex interaction\nalignment, on 1.4 million hours of diverse speech data and a broad range of\nspeech tasks. After the multi-stage training, MinMo achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across various benchmarks for voice comprehension and generation\nwhile maintaining the capabilities of text LLMs, and also facilitates\nfull-duplex conversation, that is, simultaneous two-way communication between\nthe user and the system.

This trend in limiting data information causes harm by\nhindering transparency, accountability, and innovation in the broader ecosystem\nby denying researchers, auditors, and impacted individuals access to the\ninformation needed to understand AI models.\n  While this could be mitigated by training language models on open access and\npublic domain data, at the time of writing, there are no such models (trained\nat a meaningful scale) due to the substantial technical and sociological\nchallenges in assembling the necessary corpus. These challenges include\nincomplete and unreliable metadata, the cost and complexity of digitizing\nphysical records, and the diverse set of legal and technical skills required to\nensure relevance and responsibility in a quickly changing landscape. Building\ntowards a future where AI systems can be trained on openly licensed data that\nis responsibly curated and governed requires collaboration across legal,\ntechnical, and policy domains, along with investments in metadata standards,\ndigitization, and fostering a culture of openness.",

While there is growing interest in using LLMs for critique,\ncurrent approaches still rely on human annotations or more powerful models,\nleaving the issue of enhancing critique capabilities without external\nsupervision unresolved. We introduce SCRIT (Self-evolving CRITic), a framework\nthat enables genuine self-evolution of critique abilities. Technically, SCRIT\nself-improves by training on synthetic data, generated by a contrastive-based\nself-critic that uses reference solutions for step-by-step critique, and a\nself-validation mechanism that ensures critique quality through correction\noutcomes. Implemented with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, one of the most powerful LLMs,\nSCRIT achieves up to a 10.3\\% improvement on critique-correction and error\nidentification benchmarks. Our analysis reveals that SCRIT's performance scales\npositively with data and model size, outperforms alternative approaches, and\nbenefits critically from its self-validation component.",

Unlike\nexisting methods, which treat these components as independent, LTX-Video aims\nto optimize their interaction for improved efficiency and quality. At its core\nis a carefully designed Video-VAE that achieves a high compression ratio of\n1:192, with spatiotemporal downscaling of 32 x 32 x 8 pixels per token, enabled\nby relocating the patchifying operation from the transformer's input to the\nVAE's input. Operating in this highly compressed latent space enables the\ntransformer to efficiently perform full spatiotemporal self-attention, which is\nessential for generating high-resolution videos with temporal consistency.\nHowever, the high compression inherently limits the representation of fine\ndetails. To address this, our VAE decoder is tasked with both latent-to-pixel\nconversion and the final denoising step, producing the clean result directly in\npixel space.

By optimizing a likelihood bound, it provides a\nprincipled generative approach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive\nbenchmarks, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability, outperforming our\nself-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong\nLLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive\ninstruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue.\nMoreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal\npoem completion task. Our findings establish diffusion models as a viable and\npromising alternative to ARMs, challenging the assumption that key LLM\ncapabilities discussed above are inherently tied to ARMs.",

        "summary": "While large language models have facilitated breakthroughs in many applications of artificial intelligence, their inherent largeness makes them computationally expensive and challenging to deploy in resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we document the development of SmolLM2, a state-of-the-art \"small\" (1.7 billion parameter) language model (LM). To attain strong performance, we overtrain SmolLM2 on ~11 trillion tokens of data using a multi-stage training process that mixes web text with specialized math, code, and instruction-following data. We additionally introduce new specialized datasets (FineMath, Stack-Edu, and SmolTalk) at stages where we found existing datasets to be problematically small or low-quality. To inform our design decisions, we perform both small-scale ablations as well as a manual refinement process that updates the dataset mixing rates at each stage based on the performance at the previous stage. Ultimately, we demonstrate that SmolLM2 outperforms other recent small LMs including Qwen2.5-1.5B and Llama3.2-1B. To facilitate future research on LM development as well as applications of small LMs, we release both SmolLM2 as well as all of the datasets we prepared in the course of this project.",

Additionally, most existing pre-trained LLMs fail to\ngeneralize beyond their original training sequence lengths. To enable efficient\nand practical long-context utilization, we introduce InfiniteHiP, a novel, and\npractical LLM inference framework that accelerates processing by dynamically\neliminating irrelevant context tokens through a modular hierarchical token\npruning algorithm. Our method also allows generalization to longer sequences by\nselectively applying various RoPE adjustment methods according to the internal\nattention patterns within LLMs. Furthermore, we offload the key-value cache to\nhost memory during inference, significantly reducing GPU memory pressure. As a\nresult, InfiniteHiP enables the processing of up to 3 million tokens on a\nsingle L40s 48GB GPU -- 3x larger -- without any permanent loss of context\ninformation. Our framework achieves an 18.95x speedup in attention decoding for\na 1 million token context without requiring additional training.

        "summary": "Modern large language models (LLMs) often encounter communication bottlenecks\non current hardware, rather than purely computational constraints. Multi-head\nLatent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the\nkey-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be\ncached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to\ntraditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA\nemploys an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional\ncomputation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated\nefficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers\nstill rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to\nadopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA\nwhile maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold.\nTo encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce **TransMLA**, a post-training\nmethod that converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA,\nQwen, Mixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo\nadditional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache\nsize. Furthermore, we plan to develop MLA-specific inference acceleration\ntechniques to preserve low latency in transformed models, thus enabling more\nefficient distillation of Deepseek R1.",

However, this approach is still\npotentially harmful because the model's performance on external\nquestion-answering benchmarks declines after such fine-tuning. When the\ntraining data is biased towards certain entities, the model tends to regress to\nfew overrepresented answers. In addition, we found that the model becomes more\nconfident and refuses to provide an answer in only few cases.

These approaches allow to\nreduce the amount of compute in existing language models. Despite relying on\npowerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio\nis typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in\ntheory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far\nbeyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size.\nIn this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder\nwith a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression\nratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between\nexisting and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show\nthat the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but\nby the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on\nthis sequence without any conditioning.

In the\nQuery Failure scenario, we perturb the original query to vary in domain\nexpertise, completeness, and linguistic accuracy. In the Context Failure case,\nwe simulate the uploads of degraded, irrelevant, and empty documents. We employ\nthe LLM-as-a-Judge methodology with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and use fine-grained\nrating criteria to define and calculate Robustness, Context Grounding, and\nCompliance scores for 24 off-the-shelf models. The results suggest that\nalthough some models excel at mitigating input perturbations, they must balance\nrobust answering with the ability to refrain from hallucinating.

Leveraging this insight, RAS updates only the regions\ncurrently in focus, while other regions are updated using cached noise from the\nprevious step. The model's focus is determined based on the output from the\npreceding step, capitalizing on the temporal consistency we observed. We\nevaluate RAS on Stable Diffusion 3 and Lumina-Next-T2I, achieving speedups up\nto 2.36x and 2.51x, respectively, with minimal degradation in generation\nquality. Additionally, a user study reveals that RAS delivers comparable\nqualities under human evaluation while achieving a 1.6x speedup. Our approach\nmakes a significant step towards more efficient diffusion transformers,\nenhancing their potential for real-time applications.",

        "summary": "Diffusion models have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive\nmodels in modeling discrete categorical data. Yet diffusion models that\ndirectly work on discrete data space do not fully exploit the power of\niterative refinement, as the signals are lost during the transition between\ndiscrete states. Existing continuous diffusion models for discrete data have\nlimited performance compared to discrete approaches, and the unclear link\nbetween them restricts the development of diffusion models for discrete data.\nIn this work, we propose a continuous diffusion model for language modeling\nthat incorporates the geometry of the underlying categorical distribution. We\nestablish a connection between the discrete diffusion and continuous flow on\nthe statistical manifold, and building on the analogy, we introduce a simple\ndesign for the diffusion process that generalizes previous discrete diffusion\nmodels. We further propose a simulation-free training framework based on radial\nsymmetry and a simple technique to address the high dimensionality of the\nmanifold. Comprehensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks and other\nmodalities show that our method outperforms existing discrete diffusion models\nand approaches the performance of autoregressive models.

Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits\nsparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for\nthe omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the\nsparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on\noptimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse\npatterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees\nboth the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive.\nIn this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized\nattention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the\nfirst stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the\nskip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we\ndesign an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further\nskips some matrix multiplications.

        "summary": "Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is an important method for improving the performance\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional computation during the\ninference phase. However, current studies do not systematically analyze how\npolicy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulty influence\nTTS. This lack of analysis limits the understanding and practical use of TTS\nmethods. In this paper, we focus on two core questions: (1) What is the optimal\napproach to scale test-time computation across different policy models, PRMs,\nand problem difficulty levels? (2) To what extent can extended computation\nimprove the performance of LLMs on complex tasks, and can smaller language\nmodels outperform larger ones through this approach? Through comprehensive\nexperiments on MATH-500 and challenging AIME24 tasks, we have the following\nobservations: (1) The compute-optimal TTS strategy is highly dependent on the\nchoice of policy model, PRM, and problem difficulty. (2) With our\ncompute-optimal TTS strategy, extremely small policy models can outperform\nlarger models. For example, a 1B LLM can exceed a 405B LLM on MATH-500.\nMoreover, on both MATH-500 and AIME24, a 0.5B LLM outperforms GPT-4o, a 3B LLM\nsurpasses a 405B LLM, and a 7B LLM beats o1 and DeepSeek-R1, while with higher\ninference efficiency.

Recent advances by proprietary\ncompanies, such as o-series models of OpenAI, have made remarkable progress on\nreasoning tasks. However, the complete technical details remain unrevealed, and\nthe techniques that are believed certainly to be adopted are only reinforcement\nlearning (RL) and the long chain of thoughts. This paper proposes a new RL\nframework, termed OREAL, to pursue the performance limit that can be achieved\nthrough Outcome REwArd-based reinforcement\nLearning for mathematical reasoning tasks, where only binary outcome\nrewards are easily accessible. We theoretically prove that behavior cloning on\npositive trajectories from best-of-N (BoN) sampling is sufficient to learn the\nKL-regularized optimal policy in binary feedback environments. This formulation\nfurther implies that the rewards of negative samples should be reshaped to\nensure the gradient consistency between positive and negative samples. To\nalleviate the long-existing difficulties brought by sparse rewards in RL, which\nare even exacerbated by the partial correctness of the long chain of thought\nfor reasoning tasks, we further apply a token-level reward model to sample\nimportant tokens in reasoning trajectories for learning. With OREAL, for the\nfirst time, a 7B model can obtain 94.0 pass@1 accuracy on MATH-500 through RL,\nbeing on par with 32B models. OREAL-32B also surpasses previous 32B models\ntrained by distillation with 95.0 pass@1 accuracy on MATH-500. Our\ninvestigation also indicates the importance of initial policy models and\ntraining queries for RL.

While\ndense rewards also offer an appealing choice for the reinforcement learning\n(RL) of LLMs since their fine-grained rewards have the potential to address\nsome inherent issues of outcome rewards, such as training efficiency and credit\nassignment, this potential remains largely unrealized. This can be primarily\nattributed to the challenges of training process reward models (PRMs) online,\nwhere collecting high-quality process labels is prohibitively expensive, making\nthem particularly vulnerable to reward hacking.

        "summary": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong general\nreasoning abilities, yet their effectiveness in financial reasoning remains\nunderexplored. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate 16 powerful reasoning\nand general LLMs on three complex financial tasks involving financial text,\ntabular data, and equations, assessing numerical reasoning, tabular\ninterpretation, financial terminology comprehension, long-context processing,\nand equation-based problem solving. Our results show that while better datasets\nand pretraining improve financial reasoning, general enhancements like CoT\nfine-tuning do not always yield consistent gains. Moreover, all reasoning\nstrategies face challenges in improving performance on long-context and\nmulti-table tasks. To address these limitations, we develop a financial\nreasoning-enhanced model based on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, by CoT fine-tuning and\nreinforcement learning with domain-specific reasoning paths. Even with simple\nfine-tuning with one financial dataset, our model achieves a consistent 10%\nperformance improvement across tasks, surpassing all 8B models and even\nLlama3-70B-Instruct and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct on average. Our results highlight\nthe need for domain-specific adaptations in financial tasks, emphasizing future\ndirections such as multi-table reasoning, long-context processing, and\nfinancial terminology comprehension.

        "summary": "We present a fundamental discovery that challenges our understanding of how\ncomplex reasoning emerges in large language models. While conventional wisdom\nsuggests that sophisticated reasoning tasks demand extensive training data\n(>100,000 examples), we demonstrate that complex mathematical reasoning\nabilities can be effectively elicited with surprisingly few examples. Through\ncomprehensive experiments, our proposed model LIMO demonstrates unprecedented\nperformance in mathematical reasoning. With merely 817 curated training\nsamples, LIMO achieves 57.1% accuracy on AIME and 94.8% on MATH, improving from\nprevious SFT-based models' 6.5% and 59.2% respectively, while only using 1% of\nthe training data required by previous approaches. LIMO demonstrates\nexceptional out-of-distribution generalization, achieving 40.5% absolute\nimprovement across 10 diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x\nmore data, challenging the notion that SFT leads to memorization rather than\ngeneralization. Based on these results, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning\nHypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has\nbeen comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning\ncapabilities can emerge through minimal but precisely orchestrated\ndemonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis posits that the\nelicitation threshold for complex reasoning is determined by two key factors:\n(1) the completeness of the model's encoded knowledge foundation during\npre-training, and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples as \"cognitive\ntemplates\" that show the model how to utilize its knowledge base to solve\ncomplex reasoning tasks. To facilitate reproducibility and future research in\ndata-efficient reasoning, we release LIMO as a comprehensive open-source suite\nat https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/LIMO.",

We show that this limitation\narises from the conventional pixel reconstruction objective, which biases\nmodels toward appearance fidelity at the expense of motion coherence. To\naddress this, we introduce VideoJAM, a novel framework that instills an\neffective motion prior to video generators, by encouraging the model to learn a\njoint appearance-motion representation. VideoJAM is composed of two\ncomplementary units. During training, we extend the objective to predict both\nthe generated pixels and their corresponding motion from a single learned\nrepresentation. During inference, we introduce Inner-Guidance, a mechanism that\nsteers the generation toward coherent motion by leveraging the model's own\nevolving motion prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. Notably, our framework\ncan be applied to any video model with minimal adaptations, requiring no\nmodifications to the training data or scaling of the model. VideoJAM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in motion coherence, surpassing highly competitive\nproprietary models while also enhancing the perceived visual quality of the\ngenerations. These findings emphasize that appearance and motion can be\ncomplementary and, when effectively integrated, enhance both the visual quality\nand the coherence of video generation.

However, existing\nmethods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models,\nlimiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose\nOmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by\nmixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we\nintroduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the\ncorresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable\nOmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving\nhighly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports\nvarious portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body),\nsupports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and\nchallenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to\nexisting end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more\nrealistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also\nsupports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined\ndriving signals). Video samples are provided on the ttfamily project page\n(https://omnihuman-lab.github.io)",

        "summary": "While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and its variants are widely adopted\nfor their long-context capabilities, the extension of the 1D RoPE to video,\nwith its complex spatio-temporal structure, remains an open challenge. This\nwork first introduces a comprehensive analysis that identifies four key\ncharacteristics essential for the effective adaptation of RoPE to video, which\nhave not been fully considered in prior work. As part of our analysis, we\nintroduce a challenging V-NIAH-D (Visual Needle-In-A-Haystack with Distractors)\ntask, which adds periodic distractors into V-NIAH. The V-NIAH-D task\ndemonstrates that previous RoPE variants, lacking appropriate temporal\ndimension allocation, are easily misled by distractors.

VideoRoPE features\nlow-frequency temporal allocation to mitigate periodic oscillations, a\ndiagonal layout to maintain spatial symmetry, and adjustable\ntemporal spacing to decouple temporal and spatial indexing. VideoRoPE\nconsistently surpasses previous RoPE variants, across diverse downstream tasks\nsuch as long video retrieval, video understanding, and video hallucination.

        "summary": "With the scale capability of increasing training data, model size, and\ncomputational cost, video generation has achieved impressive results in digital\ncreation, enabling users to express creativity across various domains.\nRecently, researchers in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded the scaling\nto test-time, which can significantly improve LLM performance by using more\ninference-time computation. Instead of scaling up video foundation models\nthrough expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling\n(TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation\nmodel is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much\ncan it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt. In this\nwork, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching\nproblem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target\nvideo distribution. Specifically, we build the search space with test-time\nverifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching\nprocess. Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search\nstrategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. As full-step\ndenoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs,\nwe further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called\nTree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an\nautoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on text-conditioned video\ngeneration benchmarks demonstrate that increasing test-time compute\nconsistently leads to significant improvements in the quality of videos.\nProject page: https://liuff19.github.io/Video-T1",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive versatility as general\npurpose models. However, their broad applicability comes at a high-cost\ncomputational overhead, particularly in auto-regressive decoding where each\nstep requires a forward pass. In domain-specific settings, general-purpose\ncapabilities are unnecessary and can be exchanged for efficiency. In this work,\nwe take a novel perspective on domain adaptation, reducing latency and\ncomputational costs by adapting the vocabulary to focused domains of interest.\nWe introduce AdaptiVocab, an end-to-end approach for vocabulary adaptation,\ndesigned to enhance LLM efficiency in low-resource domains. AdaptiVocab can be\napplied to any tokenizer and architecture, modifying the vocabulary by\nreplacing tokens with domain-specific n-gram-based tokens, thereby reducing the\nnumber of tokens required for both input processing and output generation.\nAdaptiVocab initializes new n-token embeddings using an exponentially weighted\ncombination of existing embeddings and employs a lightweight fine-tuning phase\nthat can be efficiently performed on a single GPU. We evaluate two 7B LLMs\nacross three niche domains, assessing efficiency, generation quality, and\nend-task performance. Our results show that AdaptiVocab reduces token usage by\nover 25% without compromising performance",

        "summary": "This work presents a framework for assessing whether large language models\n(LLMs) encode more factual knowledge in their parameters than what they express\nin their outputs. While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has\nclearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal\ndefinition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of\ncorrect-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This\ngives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information\nused to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable\ntoken-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge\narises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a\ncase study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a\nclosed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode\nmore factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an\naverage gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply hidden that a\nmodel can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to generate it even\nonce, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers. This reveals\nfundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs, which (3) puts\na practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated answer\nsampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain\ninaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they\nwere, we would be guaranteed to rank them first.",

Phi-4-Mini is a 3.8-billion-parameter language\nmodel trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly\noutperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the\nperformance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex\nreasoning. This achievement is driven by a carefully curated synthetic data\nrecipe emphasizing high-quality math and coding datasets.

Phi-4-Multimodal is a\nmultimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input\nmodalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages\nLoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes\ncombining various modalities without interference.

This paper introduces Sparse Expert Activation\nPruning (SEAP), a training-free pruning method that selectively retains\ntask-relevant parameters to reduce inference overhead. Inspired by the\nclustering patterns of hidden states and activations in LLMs, SEAP identifies\ntask-specific expert activation patterns and prunes the model while preserving\ntask performance and enhancing computational efficiency. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SEAP significantly reduces computational overhead while\nmaintaining competitive accuracy.

        "summary": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have\ndemonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks through the\nutilization of long Chain-of-thought (CoT). However, these models often suffer\nfrom hallucinations and inefficiencies due to their reliance solely on internal\nreasoning processes. In this paper, we introduce START (Self-Taught Reasoner\nwith Tools), a novel tool-integrated long CoT reasoning LLM that significantly\nenhances reasoning capabilities by leveraging external tools. Through code\nexecution, START is capable of performing complex computations, self-checking,\nexploring diverse methods, and self-debugging, thereby addressing the\nlimitations of LRMs. The core innovation of START lies in its self-learning\nframework, which comprises two key techniques: 1) Hint-infer: We demonstrate\nthat inserting artificially designed hints (e.g., ``Wait, maybe using Python\nhere is a good idea.'') during the inference process of a LRM effectively\nstimulates its ability to utilize external tools without the need for any\ndemonstration data. Hint-infer can also serve as a simple and effective\nsequential test-time scaling method; 2) Hint Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning\n(Hint-RFT): Hint-RFT combines Hint-infer and RFT by scoring, filtering, and\nmodifying the reasoning trajectories with tool invocation generated by a LRM\nvia Hint-infer, followed by fine-tuning the LRM. Through this framework, we\nhave fine-tuned the QwQ-32B model to achieve START. On PhD-level science QA\n(GPQA), competition-level math benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24, AIME25), and the\ncompetition-level code benchmark (LiveCodeBench), START achieves accuracy rates\nof 63.6%, 95.0%, 66.7%, 47.1%, and 47.3%, respectively.

To enable the streaming of multimodal information inputs,\nboth audio and visual encoders utilize a block-wise processing approach. To\nsynchronize the timestamps of video inputs with audio, we organize the audio\nand video sequentially in an interleaved manner and propose a novel position\nembedding approach, named TMRoPE(Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE). To concurrently\ngenerate text and speech while avoiding interference between the two\nmodalities, we propose Thinker-Talker architecture. In this framework,\nThinker functions as a large language model tasked with text generation, while\nTalker is a dual-track autoregressive model that directly utilizes the hidden\nrepresentations from the Thinker to produce audio tokens as output. Both the\nThinker and Talker models are designed to be trained and inferred in an\nend-to-end manner. For decoding audio tokens in a streaming manner, we\nintroduce a sliding-window DiT that restricts the receptive field, aiming to\nreduce the initial package delay.

Existing\nspeech-enabled LLMs often degrade conversational quality by modifying the LLM,\nthereby compromising its linguistic capabilities. In contrast, we propose\nLLMVoX, a lightweight 30M-parameter, LLM-agnostic, autoregressive streaming TTS\nsystem that generates high-quality speech with low latency, while fully\npreserving the capabilities of the base LLM. Our approach achieves a\nsignificantly lower Word Error Rate compared to speech-enabled LLMs, while\noperating at comparable latency and UTMOS score. By decoupling speech synthesis\nfrom LLM processing via a multi-queue token streaming system, LLMVoX supports\nseamless, infinite-length dialogues. Its plug-and-play design also facilitates\nextension to various tasks with different backbones. Furthermore, LLMVoX\ngeneralizes to new languages with only dataset adaptation, attaining a low\nCharacter Error Rate on an Arabic speech task. Additionally, we have integrated\nLLMVoX with a Vision-Language Model to create an omni-model with speech, text,\nand vision capabilities, without requiring additional multimodal training.

Specifically, YuE\nscales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while\nmaintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal\nmelodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1)\ntrack-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2)\nstructural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3)\na multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In\naddition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation,\nenabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an\nEnglish rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional\ngeneration. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or\neven surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility.\nIn addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support\nfor tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned\nrepresentations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the\nresults of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE\nbenchmark.

        "summary": "Long-context autoregressive modeling has significantly advanced language\ngeneration, but video generation still struggles to fully utilize extended\ntemporal contexts. To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce\nFrame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive\nmodeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens\n(i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous\nframes, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion\ntransformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context vision modeling\nfaces challenges due to visual redundancy. Existing RoPE lacks effective\ntemporal decay for remote context and fails to extrapolate well to long video\nsequences. Additionally, training on long videos is computationally expensive,\nas vision tokens grow much faster than language tokens. To tackle these issues,\nwe propose balancing locality and long-range dependency. We introduce FlexRoPE,\nan test-time technique that adds flexible temporal decay to RoPE, enabling\nextrapolation to 16x longer vision contexts. Furthermore, we propose long\nshort-term context modeling, where a high-resolution short-term context window\nensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an unlimited long-term context\nwindow encodes long-range information using fewer tokens. With this approach,\nwe can train on long video sequences with a manageable token context length.

        "summary": "Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs)\nhave significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as\nsequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames\nindependently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which\nlimits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long\nvideos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM\n(Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for\nMultimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated\ntemporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder\nleverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into\nimage tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame\ndynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only\nenhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token\nreduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal\nand spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM\nwithout sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques,\nour approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while\nimproving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over\nextended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves\nstate-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks\n(more than 5\\% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the\ncomputation costs by up to 8times and the decoding latency by\n2.4-2.9times for the fixed numbers of input frames.

        "summary": "Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation.\nA qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence\nwhile maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying\nviewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily\nfocuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination,\nsuch as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without\nconstraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may\nintroduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby\noverlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with\nnumerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes\nincreasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral\nspatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression\nand camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent\ngeneration. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the\ndevelopment of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset,\nwhich comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object\nactions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words,\ndetailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we\ndeveloped and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving\nspatio-temporal coherence during video generation.

In this report, we present the first\nsuccessful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal\nreasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying\nreinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47%\naccuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and\nexceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts\nand insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct\nmodels. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations\ninclude: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning\ntrajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting\nreasoning capabilities.

        "summary": "Multimodal scientific problems (MSPs) involve complex issues that require the\nintegration of multiple modalities, such as text and diagrams, presenting a\nsignificant challenge in artificial intelligence. While progress has been made\nin addressing traditional scientific problems, MSPs still face two primary\nissues: the challenge of multi-modal comprehensive reasoning in scientific\nproblem-solving and the lack of reflective and rethinking capabilities. To\naddress these issues, we introduce a Multi-Agent framework based on the Big\nSeven Personality and Socratic guidance (MAPS). This framework employs seven\ndistinct agents that leverage feedback mechanisms and the Socratic method to\nguide the resolution of MSPs. To tackle the first issue, we propose a\nprogressive four-agent solving strategy, where each agent focuses on a specific\nstage of the problem-solving process. For the second issue, we introduce a\nCritic agent, inspired by Socratic questioning, which prompts critical thinking\nand stimulates autonomous learning. We conduct extensive experiments on the\nEMMA, Olympiad, and MathVista datasets, achieving promising results that\noutperform the current SOTA model by 15.84% across all tasks. Meanwhile, the\nadditional analytical experiments also verify the model's progress as well as\ngeneralization ability.",

        "summary": "Pre-training datasets are typically collected from web content and lack\ninherent domain divisions. For instance, widely used datasets like Common Crawl\ndo not include explicit domain labels, while manually curating labeled datasets\nsuch as The Pile is labor-intensive. Consequently, identifying an optimal\npre-training data mixture remains a challenging problem, despite its\nsignificant benefits for pre-training performance. To address these challenges,\nwe propose CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping (CLIMB), an\nautomated framework that discovers, evaluates, and refines data mixtures in a\npre-training setting. Specifically, CLIMB embeds and clusters large-scale\ndatasets in a semantic space and then iteratively searches for optimal mixtures\nusing a smaller proxy model and a predictor. When continuously trained on 400B\ntokens with this mixture, our 1B model exceeds the state-of-the-art\nLlama-3.2-1B by 2.0%. Moreover, we observe that optimizing for a specific\ndomain (e.g., Social Sciences) yields a 5% improvement over random sampling.\nFinally, we introduce ClimbLab, a filtered 1.2-trillion-token corpus with 20\nclusters as a research playground, and ClimbMix, a compact yet powerful\n400-billion-token dataset designed for efficient pre-training that delivers\nsuperior performance under an equal token budget. We analyze the final data\nmixture, elucidating the characteristics of an optimal data mixture. Our data\nis available at: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/climb/",

        "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown substantial promise in\nimproving factual accuracy by grounding model responses with external knowledge\nrelevant to queries. However, most existing RAG approaches are limited to a\ntext-only corpus, and while recent efforts have extended RAG to other\nmodalities such as images and videos, they typically operate over a single\nmodality-specific corpus. In contrast, real-world queries vary widely in the\ntype of knowledge they require, which a single type of knowledge source cannot\naddress. To address this, we introduce UniversalRAG, a novel RAG framework\ndesigned to retrieve and integrate knowledge from heterogeneous sources with\ndiverse modalities and granularities. Specifically, motivated by the\nobservation that forcing all modalities into a unified representation space\nderived from a single combined corpus causes a modality gap, where the\nretrieval tends to favor items from the same modality as the query, we propose\na modality-aware routing mechanism that dynamically identifies the most\nappropriate modality-specific corpus and performs targeted retrieval within it.\nAlso, beyond modality, we organize each modality into multiple granularity\nlevels, enabling fine-tuned retrieval tailored to the complexity and scope of\nthe query. We validate UniversalRAG on 8 benchmarks spanning multiple\nmodalities, showing its superiority over modality-specific and unified\nbaselines.",

        "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in linguistic\ncapabilities, robust multilingual evaluation has become essential for promoting\nequitable technological progress. This position paper examines over 2,000\nmultilingual (non-English) benchmarks from 148 countries, published between\n2021 and 2024, to evaluate past, present, and future practices in multilingual\nbenchmarking. Our findings reveal that, despite significant investments\namounting to tens of millions of dollars, English remains significantly\noverrepresented in these benchmarks. Additionally, most benchmarks rely on\noriginal language content rather than translations, with the majority sourced\nfrom high-resource countries such as China, India, Germany, the UK, and the\nUSA. Furthermore, a comparison of benchmark performance with human judgments\nhighlights notable disparities. STEM-related tasks exhibit strong correlations\nwith human evaluations (0.70 to 0.85), while traditional NLP tasks like\nquestion answering (e.g., XQuAD) show much weaker correlations (0.11 to 0.30).\nMoreover, translating English benchmarks into other languages proves\ninsufficient, as localized benchmarks demonstrate significantly higher\nalignment with local human judgments (0.68) than their translated counterparts\n(0.47). This underscores the importance of creating culturally and\nlinguistically tailored benchmarks rather than relying solely on translations.\nThrough this comprehensive analysis, we highlight six key limitations in\ncurrent multilingual evaluation practices, propose the guiding principles\naccordingly for effective multilingual benchmarking, and outline five critical\nresearch directions to drive progress in the field. Finally, we call for a\nglobal collaborative effort to develop human-aligned benchmarks that prioritize\nreal-world applications.",

Motivated by this observation, we develop a novel class of\ntest-time optimization methods to re-weight or \"re-mixing\" the experts in\ndifferent layers jointly for each test sample. Since the test sample's ground\ntruth is unknown, we propose to optimize a surrogate objective defined by the\nsample's \"successful neighbors\" from a reference set of samples. We introduce\nthree surrogates and algorithms based on mode-finding, kernel regression, and\nthe average loss of similar reference samples/tasks. To reduce the cost of\noptimizing whole pathways, we apply our algorithms merely to the core experts'\nmixing weights in critical layers, which enjoy similar performance but save\nsignificant computation. This leads to \"Critical-Layer, Core-Expert,\nCollaborative Pathway Optimization (C3PO)\". We apply C3PO to two recent MoE\nLLMs and examine it on six widely-used benchmarks. It consistently improves the\nbase model by 7-15% in accuracy and outperforms widely used test-time learning\nbaselines, e.g., in-context learning and prompt/prefix tuning, by a large\nmargin. Moreover, C3PO enables MoE LLMs with 1-3B active parameters to\noutperform LLMs of 7-9B parameters, hence improving MoE's advantages on\nefficiency.

However, individual attention weights are determined by\nthe similarity of only a single query and key token vector. This \"single token\nattention\" bottlenecks the amount of information used in distinguishing a\nrelevant part from the rest of the context. To address this issue, we propose a\nnew attention method, Multi-Token Attention (MTA), which allows LLMs to\ncondition their attention weights on multiple query and key vectors\nsimultaneously. This is achieved by applying convolution operations over\nqueries, keys and heads, allowing nearby queries and keys to affect each\nother's attention weights for more precise attention. As a result, our method\ncan locate relevant context using richer, more nuanced information that can\nexceed a single vector's capacity. Through extensive evaluations, we\ndemonstrate that MTA achieves enhanced performance on a range of popular\nbenchmarks.

Rather than adapting a\ntext-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model\n(MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and\nlinguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora\nduring a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively\naddresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in\nconventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve\nperformance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position\nencoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced\npost-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed\npreference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies\nalongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of\nmulti-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the\nMMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its\ncapabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models,\nincluding ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also\nmaintaining strong pure-language proficiency. In pursuit of open-science\nprinciples, we will publicly release both the training data and model weights\nto foster further research and development in next-generation MLLMs.",

Technically, we first identify that the\nvisual-spatial reasoning capacities of small- to medium-sized Qwen2-VL models\ncannot be activated via Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts. We then incorporate\nGRPO training for improved visual-spatial reasoning, using the carefully\ncurated VSI-100k dataset, following DeepSeek-R1-Zero. During the investigation,\nwe identify the necessity to keep the KL penalty (even with a small value) in\nGRPO. With just 120 GPU hours, our vsGRPO-2B model, fine-tuned from\nQwen2-VL-2B, can outperform the base model by 12.1% and surpass GPT-4o.\nMoreover, our vsGRPO-7B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-7B, achieves\nperformance comparable to that of the best open-source model\nLLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B.

One particularly intriguing application is transforming\ncharacters from anime films into interactive, playable entities.

Such games are\ndefined as infinite game since they eliminate predetermined boundaries and\nfixed gameplay rules, where players can interact with the game world through\nopen-ended language and experience ever-evolving storylines and environments.\nRecently, a pioneering approach for infinite anime life simulation employs\nlarge language models (LLMs) to translate multi-turn text dialogues into\nlanguage instructions for image generation.

While\nconsumer hardware is getting stronger and model quantization is improving,\nexisting end-side solutions still demand GPU clusters, large RAM/VRAM, and high\nbandwidth, far beyond what a common home cluster can handle. This paper\nintroduces prima.cpp, a distributed inference system that runs 70B-scale models\non everyday home devices using a mix of CPU/GPU, low RAM/VRAM, Wi-Fi, and\ncross-platform support. It uses mmap to manage model weights and introduces\npiped-ring parallelism with prefetching to hide disk loading. By modeling\nheterogeneity in computation, communication, disk, memory (and its management\nbehavior), and OS, it optimally assigns model layers to each device's CPU and\nGPU, further reducing token latency. An elegant algorithm named Halda is\nproposed to solve this NP-hard assignment problem. We evaluate prima.cpp on a\ncommon four-node home cluster. It outperforms llama.cpp, exo, and dllama on\n30B+ models while keeping memory pressure below 6%.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle\nincreasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content\ngeneration, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long\ninference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to\nexpedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks,\nexploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown\nthat LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation\nframeworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent\nsub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks\nmay not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their\napplicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM\n\"workers\" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated\nattention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our\napproach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy\nfor the problem at hand, all the while \"seeing\" each other's partial progress\nin the concurrent cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a\nparallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in\nparallel with the same attention cache, with \"instant\" access to each other's\ngenerated tokens. Hogwild! inference takes advantage of Rotary Position\nEmbeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware\nutilization.

        "summary": "We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward using one training\nexample (1-shot RLVR) is effective in incentivizing the math reasoning\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs). Applying RLVR to the base model\nQwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance\non MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6%, and improves the average performance across six\ncommon mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7%. This result\nmatches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500:\n73.6%, average: 35.9%), which includes the aforementioned example. Similar\nsubstantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B,\nLlama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and\nPPO), and different math examples (many of which yield approximately 30% or\ngreater improvement on MATH500 when employed as a single training example). In\naddition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including\ncross-domain generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and\nsustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has\nsaturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we\nverify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy\ngradient loss, distinguishing it from the \"grokking\" phenomenon. We also show\nthe critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by adding entropy loss with\nan appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. As a bonus, we observe\nthat applying entropy loss alone, without any outcome reward, significantly\nenhances Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B's performance on MATH500 by 27.4%.

        "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently\ndemonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs,\nparticularly in mathematics and programming tasks. It is widely believed that\nRLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning\nabilities that exceed corresponding base models' capacity. In this study,\nhowever, we critically re-examines this assumption by measuring the\npass@k metric with large values of k to explore the reasoning\ncapability boundary of the models across a wide range of model families and\nbenchmarks. Surprisingly, the RL does not, in fact, elicit fundamentally\nnew reasoning patterns. While RL-trained models outperform their base models at\nsmaller values of k (\\eg, k=1), base models can achieve a comparable or\neven higher pass@k score compared to their RL counterparts at large k\nvalues. The reasoning paths generated by RL-trained models are already included\nin the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that most reasoning\nabilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models.\nFurther analysis shows that RL training boosts the performance by biasing the\nmodel's output distribution toward paths that are more likely to yield rewards,\ntherefore sampling correct responses more efficiently. But this also results in\na narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. Similar\nresults are observed in visual reasoning tasks trained with RLVR. Moreover, we\nfind that distillation can genuinely introduce new knowledge into the model,\ndifferent from RLVR. These findings underscore a critical limitation of RLVR in\nadvancing LLM reasoning abilities which requires us to fundamentally rethink\nthe impact of RL training in reasoning LLMs and the need of a better paradigm.\nProject Page: https://limit-of-RLVR.github.io",

In this work, we investigate how to\nimprove reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries,\ni.e. the inference-time scalability of generalist RM, and further,\nhow to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper\nlearning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward\nmodeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential\nfor inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled\nCritique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs\nthrough online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately,\nresulting in DeepSeek-GRM models. Furthermore, for effective\ninference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and\nintroduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance.\nEmpirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and\nscalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM\nbenchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared\nto training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks,\nwhich we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward\nsystems. The models will be released and open-sourced.",

        "summary": "While reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek R1) trained with reinforcement\nlearning (RL), excel in textual reasoning, they struggle in scenarios requiring\nstructured problem-solving, such as geometric reasoning, concise computation,\nor complex equation solving-areas where computational tools like code\ninterpreters (CI) demonstrate distinct advantages. To bridge this gap, we\npropose ReTool, which enhances long-form reasoning with tool-integrated\nlearning, including two key features: (1) dynamic interleaving of real-time\ncode execution within natural language reasoning processes, and (2) an\nautomated RL paradigm that allows policy rollouts with multi-turn real-time\ncode execution and teaches the model in learning when and how to invoke tools\nbased on outcome feedback. ReTool employs a systematic training framework,\nbeginning with synthetic cold-start data generation to produce code-augmented\nlong-form reasoning traces for fine-tuning base models. Subsequent RL training\nleverages task outcomes as rewards to iteratively refine the model's tool use\nstrategy, enabling autonomous discovery of optimal tool invocation patterns\nwithout human priors. Experiments on the challenging MATH Olympiad benchmark\nAIME demonstrate ReTool's superiority: Our 32B model achieves 67% accuracy with\n400 training steps, outperforming text-based RL baseline (40% accuracy, 1080\nsteps) in efficiency and performance. Remarkably, ReTool-32B attains 72.5%\naccuracy in extended settings, surpassing OpenAI's o1-preview by 27.9%. Further\nanalysis reveals emergent behaviors such as code self-correction, signaling an\n''aha moment'' in which the model autonomously masters adaptive tool use.

Chatbot Arena has emerged as the go-to leaderboard\nfor ranking the most capable AI systems. Yet, in this work we identify\nsystematic issues that have resulted in a distorted playing field. We find that\nundisclosed private testing practices benefit a handful of providers who are\nable to test multiple variants before public release and retract scores if\ndesired. We establish that the ability of these providers to choose the best\nscore leads to biased Arena scores due to selective disclosure of performance\nresults. At an extreme, we identify 27 private LLM variants tested by Meta in\nthe lead-up to the Llama-4 release. We also establish that proprietary closed\nmodels are sampled at higher rates (number of battles) and have fewer models\nremoved from the arena than open-weight and open-source alternatives. Both\nthese policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time. Providers like\nGoogle and OpenAI have received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the\narena, respectively.

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain\ncomputationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address\nthis, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into\nsmaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher\nLLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual\nknowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited\ncapability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for\ntransferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from\nLLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent\ndistillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method\ncalled first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated\ntrajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for\nimproving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight\nreasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both\nin-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small\nas 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier\nlarger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the\npotential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small\nagents.

Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code\ngeneration or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive\ntasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive\nSWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks\nquickly become outdated due to contamination issues.

Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset\ncomprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for\nreinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous\nsupply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a\ncontamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare\nresults of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and\nshow that performance of some language models might be inflated due to\ncontamination issues.",

        "summary": "Web navigation is a unique domain that can automate many repetitive real-life\ntasks and is challenging as it requires long-horizon sequential decision making\nbeyond typical multimodal large language model (MLLM) tasks. Yet, specialized\nreward models for web navigation that can be utilized during both training and\ntest-time have been absent until now. Despite the importance of speed and\ncost-effectiveness, prior works have utilized MLLMs as reward models, which\nposes significant constraints for real-world deployment. To address this, in\nthis work, we propose the first process reward model (PRM) called Web-Shepherd\nwhich could assess web navigation trajectories in a step-level. To achieve\nthis, we first construct the WebPRM Collection, a large-scale dataset with 40K\nstep-level preference pairs and annotated checklists spanning diverse domains\nand difficulty levels. Next, we also introduce the WebRewardBench, the first\nmeta-evaluation benchmark for evaluating PRMs. In our experiments, we observe\nthat our Web-Shepherd achieves about 30 points better accuracy compared to\nusing GPT-4o on WebRewardBench. Furthermore, when testing on WebArena-lite by\nusing GPT-4o-mini as the policy and Web-Shepherd as the verifier, we achieve\n10.9 points better performance, in 10 less cost compared to using GPT-4o-mini\nas the verifier.

        "summary": "Recent years have seen remarkable progress in both multimodal understanding\nmodels and image generation models. Despite their respective successes, these\ntwo domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural\nparadigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal\nunderstanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image\ngeneration. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified\nframeworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new\ncapabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for\nunification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains\npose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts\ntoward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future\nresearch. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements\nin multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we\nreview existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural\nparadigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that\nfuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the\nstructural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally,\nwe compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering\nresources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing\nthis nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and\ndata. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid\nadvancements and will regularly update this survey.

Although design choices for image\nunderstanding have been extensively studied, the optimal model architecture and\ntraining recipe for a unified framework with image generation remain\nunderexplored. Motivated by the strong potential of autoregressive and\ndiffusion models for high-quality generation and scalability, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study of their use in unified multimodal settings, with emphasis\non image representations, modeling objectives, and training strategies.\nGrounded in these investigations, we introduce a novel approach that employs a\ndiffusion transformer to generate semantically rich CLIP image features, in\ncontrast to conventional VAE-based representations. This design yields both\nhigher training efficiency and improved generative quality. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that a sequential pretraining strategy for unified models-first\ntraining on image understanding and subsequently on image generation-offers\npractical advantages by preserving image understanding capability while\ndeveloping strong image generation ability.

        "summary": "We introduce MMaDA, a novel class of multimodal diffusion foundation models\ndesigned to achieve superior performance across diverse domains such as textual\nreasoning, multimodal understanding, and text-to-image generation. The approach\nis distinguished by three key innovations: (i) MMaDA adopts a unified diffusion\narchitecture with a shared probabilistic formulation and a modality-agnostic\ndesign, eliminating the need for modality-specific components. This\narchitecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data\ntypes. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning\nstrategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities. By aligning\nreasoning processes between textual and visual domains, this strategy\nfacilitates cold-start training for the final reinforcement learning (RL)\nstage, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex tasks from the\noutset. (iii) We propose UniGRPO, a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm\nspecifically tailored for diffusion foundation models. Utilizing diversified\nreward modeling, UniGRPO unifies post-training across both reasoning and\ngeneration tasks, ensuring consistent performance improvements. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that MMaDA-8B exhibits strong generalization capabilities\nas a unified multimodal foundation model. It surpasses powerful models like\nLLaMA-3-7B and Qwen2-7B in textual reasoning, outperforms Show-o and SEED-X in\nmultimodal understanding, and excels over SDXL and Janus in text-to-image\ngeneration. These achievements highlight MMaDA's effectiveness in bridging the\ngap between pretraining and post-training within unified diffusion\narchitectures, providing a comprehensive framework for future research and\ndevelopment.

        "summary": "Pre-training equips text-to-image (T2I) models with broad world knowledge,\nbut this alone is often insufficient to achieve high aesthetic quality and\nalignment. Consequently, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is crucial for further\nrefinement. However, its effectiveness highly depends on the quality of the\nfine-tuning dataset. Existing public SFT datasets frequently target narrow\ndomains (e.g., anime or specific art styles), and the creation of high-quality,\ngeneral-purpose SFT datasets remains a significant challenge. Current curation\nmethods are often costly and struggle to identify truly impactful samples. This\nchallenge is further complicated by the scarcity of public general-purpose\ndatasets, as leading models often rely on large, proprietary, and poorly\ndocumented internal data, hindering broader research progress. This paper\nintroduces a novel methodology for creating general-purpose SFT datasets by\nleveraging a pre-trained generative model as an estimator of high-impact\ntraining samples. We apply this methodology to construct and release Alchemist,\na compact (3,350 samples) yet highly effective SFT dataset.

        "summary": "Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have\nsignificantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their\nspatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on\nadditional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their\nutility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this\npaper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial\nreasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which\nrely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our\nkey insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward\nvisual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder\narchitecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and\na spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to\nextract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into\nunified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we\npropose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects\nthe spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under\nlimited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial\nreasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k\ndataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO.\nExtensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nspatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of\nvisual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

Building on this benchmark, we propose\nPosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser\ndistills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns\ntext-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and\nspatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by\nexecuting rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and\nensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o\noutputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and\npoor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary\naesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual\nsemantics to convey meaning.

        "summary": "Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with\nhuman preferences, especially through reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should\nstimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a\nscore or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores\nor directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle\nto integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability.\nInspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on\nreasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating\nreasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's\ninterpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of\ngenerative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which\nformulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented\ntraining pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists\nof two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2)\nreinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by\nself-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating\ncandidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve\nstate-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across\nmultiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger\nopen-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by\nup to 13.8%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis\nto understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training.

In artificial\nintelligence, as systems increasingly operate in open, uncertain, and\nmultimodal environments, reasoning becomes essential for enabling robust and\nadaptive behavior. Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a\npromising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and\nvideo to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve\ncomprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning. As\nresearch advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular,\nperception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer\nmore coherent cross-modal understanding. While instruction tuning and\nreinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges\nremain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior. To\naddress these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of\nmultimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental\nroadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging\ncapabilities. First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules,\nwhere reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation,\nalignment, and fusion. Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning\ninto multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)\nand multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured\nreasoning chains.

Recent RLVR works that operate under the\nzero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still\ndepend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training.\nThe scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the\nlong-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already\nevident in the domain of language model pretraining.

        "summary": "This paper aims to overcome a major obstacle in scaling RL for reasoning with\nLLMs, namely the collapse of policy entropy. Such phenomenon is consistently\nobserved across vast RL runs without entropy intervention, where the policy\nentropy dropped sharply at the early training stage, this diminished\nexploratory ability is always accompanied with the saturation of policy\nperformance. In practice, we establish a transformation equation R=-a*e^H+b\nbetween entropy H and downstream performance R. This empirical law strongly\nindicates that, the policy performance is traded from policy entropy, thus\nbottlenecked by its exhaustion, and the ceiling is fully predictable H=0,\nR=-a+b. Our finding necessitates entropy management for continuous exploration\ntoward scaling compute for RL. To this end, we investigate entropy dynamics\nboth theoretically and empirically. Our derivation highlights that, the change\nin policy entropy is driven by the covariance between action probability and\nthe change in logits, which is proportional to its advantage when using Policy\nGradient-like algorithms. Empirical study shows that, the values of covariance\nterm and entropy differences matched exactly, supporting the theoretical\nconclusion. Moreover, the covariance term stays mostly positive throughout\ntraining, further explaining why policy entropy would decrease monotonically.\nThrough understanding the mechanism behind entropy dynamics, we motivate to\ncontrol entropy by restricting the update of high-covariance tokens.\nSpecifically, we propose two simple yet effective techniques, namely Clip-Cov\nand KL-Cov, which clip and apply KL penalty to tokens with high covariances\nrespectively. Experiments show that these methods encourage exploration, thus\nhelping policy escape entropy collapse and achieve better downstream\nperformance.",

        "summary": "Recently, large reasoning models have achieved impressive performance on\nvarious tasks by employing human-like deep thinking. However, the lengthy\nthinking process substantially increases inference overhead, making efficiency\na critical bottleneck. In this work, we first demonstrate that NoThinking,\nwhich prompts the reasoning model to skip thinking and directly generate the\nfinal solution, is a better choice for relatively simple tasks in terms of both\nperformance and efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose AdaptThink, a novel\nRL algorithm to teach reasoning models to choose the optimal thinking mode\nadaptively based on problem difficulty. Specifically, AdaptThink features two\ncore components: (1) a constrained optimization objective that encourages the\nmodel to choose NoThinking while maintaining the overall performance; (2) an\nimportance sampling strategy that balances Thinking and NoThinking samples\nduring on-policy training, thereby enabling cold start and allowing the model\nto explore and exploit both thinking modes throughout the training process.

        "summary": "Recent advances in multimodal Reward Models (RMs) have shown significant\npromise in delivering reward signals to align vision models with human\npreferences. However, current RMs are generally restricted to providing direct\nresponses or engaging in shallow reasoning processes with limited depth, often\nleading to inaccurate reward signals. We posit that incorporating explicit long\nchains of thought (CoT) into the reward reasoning process can significantly\nstrengthen their reliability and robustness. Furthermore, we believe that once\nRMs internalize CoT reasoning, their direct response accuracy can also be\nimproved through implicit reasoning capabilities. To this end, this paper\nproposes UnifiedReward-Think, the first unified multimodal CoT-based reward\nmodel, capable of multi-dimensional, step-by-step long-chain reasoning for both\nvisual understanding and generation reward tasks. Specifically, we adopt an\nexploration-driven reinforcement fine-tuning approach to elicit and incentivize\nthe model's latent complex reasoning ability: (1) We first use a small amount\nof image generation preference data to distill the reasoning process of GPT-4o,\nwhich is then used for the model's cold start to learn the format and structure\nof CoT reasoning. (2) Subsequently, by leveraging the model's prior knowledge\nand generalization capabilities, we prepare large-scale unified multimodal\npreference data to elicit the model's reasoning process across various vision\ntasks. During this phase, correct reasoning outputs are retained for rejection\nsampling to refine the model (3) while incorrect predicted samples are finally\nused for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to explore diverse reasoning paths and optimize\nfor correct and robust solutions. Extensive experiments across various vision\nreward tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model.",

Despite the\nsignificant advancement in multimodal reasoning, existing benchmarks fail to\ncomprehensively evaluate their reasoning abilities due to the lack of explicit\ncategorization for logical reasoning types and an unclear understanding of\nreasoning. To address these issues, we introduce MME-Reasoning, a comprehensive\nbenchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of MLLMs, which covers all\nthree types of reasoning (i.e., inductive, deductive, and abductive) in its\nquestions. We carefully curate the data to ensure that each question\neffectively evaluates reasoning ability rather than perceptual skills or\nknowledge breadth, and extend the evaluation protocols to cover the evaluation\nof diverse questions. Our evaluation reveals substantial limitations of\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs when subjected to holistic assessments of logical\nreasoning capabilities. Even the most advanced MLLMs show limited performance\nin comprehensive logical reasoning, with notable performance imbalances across\nreasoning types. In addition, we conducted an in-depth analysis of approaches\nsuch as ``thinking mode'' and Rule-based RL, which are commonly believed to\nenhance reasoning abilities.

Recent advances in grokking have demonstrated\nthat neural networks can transition from memorizing to perfectly generalizing\nonce they detect underlying logical patterns - yet these studies have primarily\nused small, synthetic tasks. In this paper, for the first time, we extend\ngrokking to real-world factual data and address the challenge of dataset\nsparsity by augmenting existing knowledge graphs with carefully designed\nsynthetic data to raise the ratio phi_r of inferred facts to atomic facts\nabove the threshold required for grokking. Surprisingly, we find that even\nfactually incorrect synthetic data can strengthen emergent reasoning circuits\nrather than degrade accuracy, as it forces the model to rely on relational\nstructure rather than memorization. When evaluated on multi-hop reasoning\nbenchmarks, our approach achieves up to 95-100% accuracy on 2WikiMultiHopQA -\nsubstantially improving over strong baselines and matching or exceeding current\nstate-of-the-art results. We further provide an in-depth analysis of how\nincreasing phi_r drives the formation of generalizing circuits inside\nTransformers.

Training models directly in\nlow-precision arithmetic offers a solution, by improving both computational\nthroughput and energy efficiency. Specifically, NVIDIA's recent Blackwell\narchitecture facilitates extremely low-precision operations, specifically FP4\nvariants, promising substantial efficiency gains. Yet, current algorithms for\ntraining LLMs in FP4 precision face significant accuracy degradation and often\nrely on mixed-precision fallbacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate\nhardware-supported FP4 training and introduce Quartet, a new approach enabling\naccurate, end-to-end FP4 training with all the major computations (in e.g.\nlinear layers) being performed in low precision. Through extensive evaluations\non Llama-type models, we reveal a new low-precision scaling law that quantifies\nperformance trade-offs across varying bit-widths and allows us to identify a\n\"near-optimal\" low-precision training technique in terms of\naccuracy-vs-computation, called Quartet. We implement Quartet using optimized\nCUDA kernels tailored for NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, and show that it can achieve\nstate-of-the-art accuracy for FP4 precision, successfully training\nbillion-scale models.

We introduce the third and\nmore inference-efficient scaling paradigm: increasing the model's parallel\ncomputation during both training and inference time. We apply P diverse and\nlearnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in\nparallel, and dynamically aggregate the P outputs. This method, namely\nparallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing\nparameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure,\ndata, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it\nthrough large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with P parallel\nstreams is similar to scaling the parameters by O(log P) while showing\nsuperior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22times\nless memory increase and 6times less latency increase compared to parameter\nscaling that achieves the same performance improvement.

Initially limited to understanding multiple modalities, these models\nhave advanced to not only comprehend but also generate across modalities. Their\ncapabilities have expanded from coarse-grained to fine-grained multimodal\nunderstanding and from supporting limited modalities to arbitrary ones. While\nmany benchmarks exist to assess MLLMs, a critical question arises: Can we\nsimply assume that higher performance across tasks indicates a stronger MLLM\ncapability, bringing us closer to human-level AI? We argue that the answer is\nnot as straightforward as it seems. This project introduces General-Level, an\nevaluation framework that defines 5-scale levels of MLLM performance and\ngenerality, offering a methodology to compare MLLMs and gauge the progress of\nexisting systems towards more robust multimodal generalists and, ultimately,\ntowards AGI. At the core of the framework is the concept of Synergy, which\nmeasures whether models maintain consistent capabilities across comprehension\nand generation, and across multiple modalities. To support this evaluation, we\npresent General-Bench, which encompasses a broader spectrum of skills,\nmodalities, formats, and capabilities, including over 700 tasks and 325,800\ninstances. The evaluation results that involve over 100 existing\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs uncover the capability rankings of generalists,\nhighlighting the challenges in reaching genuine AI.

Leveraging this insight, we introduce **Roads\nto Rome (R2R)**, a neural token routing method that selectively utilizes LLMs\nonly for these critical, path-divergent tokens, while leaving the majority of\ntoken generation to the SLM. We also develop an automatic data generation\npipeline that identifies divergent tokens and generates token-level routing\nlabels to train the lightweight router.

        "summary": "A recent study showed that large language models (LLMs) can reconstruct\nsurprisingly long texts - up to thousands of tokens - via autoregressive\ngeneration from just one specially trained input embedding. In this work, we\nexplore whether such reconstruction is possible without autoregression. We show\nthat frozen LLMs can generate hundreds of accurate tokens in just one forward\npass, when provided with only two learned embeddings. This reveals a surprising\nand underexplored capability of LLMs - multi-token generation without iterative\ndecoding. We investigate the behaviour of these embeddings and provide insight\ninto the type of information they encode. We also empirically show that\nalthough these representations are not unique for a given text, they form\nconnected and local regions in embedding space - a property that suggests the\npotential of learning a dedicated encoder into that space.",

        "summary": "In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm, termed Chain-of-Model\n(CoM), which incorporates the causal relationship into the hidden states of\neach layer as a chain style, thereby introducing great scaling efficiency in\nmodel training and inference flexibility in deployment. We introduce the\nconcept of Chain-of-Representation (CoR), which formulates the hidden states at\neach layer as a combination of multiple sub-representations (i.e., chains) at\nthe hidden dimension level. In each layer, each chain from the output\nrepresentations can only view all of its preceding chains in the input\nrepresentations. Consequently, the model built upon CoM framework can\nprogressively scale up the model size by increasing the chains based on the\nprevious models (i.e., chains), and offer multiple sub-models at varying sizes\nfor elastic inference by using different chain numbers. Based on this\nprinciple, we devise Chain-of-Language-Model (CoLM), which incorporates the\nidea of CoM into each layer of Transformer architecture. Based on CoLM, we\nfurther introduce CoLM-Air by introducing a KV sharing mechanism, that computes\nall keys and values within the first chain and then shares across all chains.\nThis design demonstrates additional extensibility, such as enabling seamless LM\nswitching, prefilling acceleration and so on. Experimental results demonstrate\nour CoLM family can achieve comparable performance to the standard Transformer,\nwhile simultaneously enabling greater flexiblity, such as progressive scaling\nto improve training efficiency and offer multiple varying model sizes for\nelastic inference, paving a a new way toward building language models.

        "summary": "In this work, we present Qwen3, the latest version of the Qwen model family.\nQwen3 comprises a series of large language models (LLMs) designed to advance\nperformance, efficiency, and multilingual capabilities. The Qwen3 series\nincludes models of both dense and Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architectures, with\nparameter scales ranging from 0.6 to 235 billion. A key innovation in Qwen3 is\nthe integration of thinking mode (for complex, multi-step reasoning) and\nnon-thinking mode (for rapid, context-driven responses) into a unified\nframework. This eliminates the need to switch between different models--such as\nchat-optimized models (e.g., GPT-4o) and dedicated reasoning models (e.g.,\nQwQ-32B)--and enables dynamic mode switching based on user queries or chat\ntemplates. Meanwhile, Qwen3 introduces a thinking budget mechanism, allowing\nusers to allocate computational resources adaptively during inference, thereby\nbalancing latency and performance based on task complexity. Moreover, by\nleveraging the knowledge from the flagship models, we significantly reduce the\ncomputational resources required to build smaller-scale models, while ensuring\ntheir highly competitive performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that\nQwen3 achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks, including\ntasks in code generation, mathematical reasoning, agent tasks, etc.,\ncompetitive against larger MoE models and proprietary models. Compared to its\npredecessor Qwen2.5, Qwen3 expands multilingual support from 29 to 119\nlanguages and dialects, enhancing global accessibility through improved\ncross-lingual understanding and generation capabilities. To facilitate\nreproducibility and community-driven research and development, all Qwen3 models\nare publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.",

        "summary": "Effective information searching is essential for enhancing the reasoning and\ngeneration capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent research has\nexplored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities\nby interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these\napproaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1)\nUncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search\nengines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the\ntraining process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires\nfrequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search\nrequests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain\nscalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a\nreinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the search capabilities of\nLLMs without interacting with real search engines. Our approach begins with\nlightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module\ncapable of generating both relevant and noisy documents in response to a query.\nDuring RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that\nincrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively\neliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly\nchallenging retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nZeroSearch effectively incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs using a 3B\nLLM as the retrieval module. Remarkably, a 7B retrieval module achieves\ncomparable performance to the real search engine, while a 14B retrieval module\neven surpasses it. Furthermore, it generalizes well across both base and\ninstruction-tuned models of various parameter sizes and is compatible with a\nwide range of RL algorithms.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory\nresources, creating deployment challenges. Quantization-aware training (QAT)\naddresses these challenges by reducing model precision while maintaining\nperformance. However, the scaling behavior of QAT, especially at 4-bit\nprecision (W4A4), is not well understood. Existing QAT scaling laws often\nignore key factors such as the number of training tokens and quantization\ngranularity, which limits their applicability. This paper proposes a unified\nscaling law for QAT that models quantization error as a function of model size,\ntraining data volume, and quantization group size. Through 268 QAT experiments,\nwe show that quantization error decreases as model size increases, but rises\nwith more training tokens and coarser quantization granularity. To identify the\nsources of W4A4 quantization error, we decompose it into weight and activation\ncomponents. Both components follow the overall trend of W4A4 quantization\nerror, but with different sensitivities. Specifically, weight quantization\nerror increases more rapidly with more training tokens. Further analysis shows\nthat the activation quantization error in the FC2 layer, caused by outliers, is\nthe primary bottleneck of W4A4 QAT quantization error. By applying\nmixed-precision quantization to address this bottleneck, we demonstrate that\nweight and activation quantization errors can converge to similar levels.\nAdditionally, with more training data, weight quantization error eventually\nexceeds activation quantization error, suggesting that reducing weight\nquantization error is also important in such scenarios. These findings offer\nkey insights for improving QAT research and development.",

Motivated by this, we introduce\nthe novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to\ndesign system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable\nto unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning\nframework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various\nuser prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user\nprompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct\nexperiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we\nshow that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to\ndiverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system\nprompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer\noptimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved\nperformance.",

To address this, we introduce BizFinBench, the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world financial\napplications. BizFinBench consists of 6,781 well-annotated queries in Chinese,\nspanning five dimensions: numerical calculation, reasoning, information\nextraction, prediction recognition, and knowledge-based question answering,\ngrouped into nine fine-grained categories. The benchmark includes both\nobjective and subjective metrics. We also introduce IteraJudge, a novel LLM\nevaluation method that reduces bias when LLMs serve as evaluators in objective\nmetrics. We benchmark 25 models, including both proprietary and open-source\nsystems.

        "summary": "Photo retouching has become integral to contemporary visual storytelling,\nenabling users to capture aesthetics and express creativity. While professional\ntools such as Adobe Lightroom offer powerful capabilities, they demand\nsubstantial expertise and manual effort. In contrast, existing AI-based\nsolutions provide automation but often suffer from limited adjustability and\npoor generalization, failing to meet diverse and personalized editing needs. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model\n(MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process\nof professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching\ntools within Lightroom. JarvisArt undergoes a two-stage training process: an\ninitial Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning to establish basic reasoning\nand tool-use skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for\nRetouching (GRPO-R) to further enhance its decision-making and tool\nproficiency. We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate\nseamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop\nMMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits.\nJarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and\nfine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new\navenue for intelligent photo retouching. Notably, it outperforms GPT-4o with a\n60% improvement in average pixel-level metrics on MMArt-Bench for content\nfidelity, while maintaining comparable instruction-following capabilities.\nProject Page: https://jarvisart.vercel.app/.",

Recently, OpenAI released\ntheir powerful GPT-4o-Image model for comprehensive image perception and\nmanipulation, achieving expressive capability and attracting community\ninterests. By observing the performance of GPT-4o-Image in our carefully\nconstructed experiments, we infer that GPT-4o-Image leverages features\nextracted by semantic encoders instead of VAE, while VAEs are considered\nessential components in many image manipulation models. Motivated by such\ninspiring observations, we present a unified generative framework named\nUniWorld based on semantic features provided by powerful visual-language models\nand contrastive semantic encoders. As a result, we build a strong unified model\nusing only 1% amount of BAGEL's data, which consistently outperforms BAGEL on\nimage editing benchmarks.

        "summary": "We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that\njointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct\n3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce\nmonolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an\nimage and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,\ncompositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented\ninputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D\nparts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and\ncomplex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh\ndiffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained\nweights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A\ncompositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of\ndisentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables\nstructured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,\nensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.\nTo support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level\nannotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that\nPartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D\nmeshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,\ndemonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding\nand synthesis.

        "summary": "In visual generation, the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms\nresults in high memory and computational costs, especially for longer token\nsequences required in high-resolution image or multi-frame video generation. To\naddress this, prior research has explored techniques such as sparsification and\nquantization. However, these techniques face significant challenges under low\ndensity and reduced bitwidths. Through systematic analysis, we identify that\nthe core difficulty stems from the dispersed and irregular characteristics of\nvisual attention patterns. Therefore, instead of introducing specialized\nsparsification and quantization design to accommodate such patterns, we propose\nan alternative strategy: *reorganizing* the attention pattern to alleviate the\nchallenges. Inspired by the local aggregation nature of visual feature\nextraction, we design a novel **Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)**\ntechnique, which unifies the diverse attention patterns into a\nhardware-friendly block-wise pattern. This unification substantially simplifies\nand enhances both sparsification and quantization. We evaluate the\nperformance-efficiency trade-offs of various design choices and finalize a\nmethodology tailored for the unified pattern. Our approach, **PAROAttention**,\nachieves video and image generation with lossless metrics, and nearly identical\nresults from full-precision (FP) baselines, while operating at notably lower\ndensity (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (**INT8/INT4**), achieving a **1.9x** to\n**2.7x** end-to-end latency speedup.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate\nsignificant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive\ncomputational cost during inference. While several distillation-based\napproaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,\nextending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,\nparticularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In\nthis work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,\nwhich performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the\nchallenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several\nenhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,\nan adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is\ndynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window\ninconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a\npredefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training\ntowards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,\nincluding a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing\ntraining efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve\ncomparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a\nsingle step.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a\npowerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work,\nwe undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of\ntoken entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens\ninfluence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of\ntokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer\nthe model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy\npatterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the\nbase model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy\ntokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e.,\nforking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy\ngradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20\nrule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable\nto full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly\nsurpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71\non AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models,\nhighlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the\n80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These\nfindings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing\nthe high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our\nresults highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy\nperspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to\nfurther improve LLM reasoning.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in reasoning-centric language models have highlighted\nreinforcement learning (RL) as a promising method for aligning models with\nverifiable rewards. However, it remains contentious whether RL truly expands a\nmodel's reasoning capabilities or merely amplifies high-reward outputs already\nlatent in the base model's distribution, and whether continually scaling up RL\ncompute reliably leads to improved reasoning performance. In this work, we\nchallenge prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that prolonged RL (ProRL)\ntraining can uncover novel reasoning strategies that are inaccessible to base\nmodels, even under extensive sampling. We introduce ProRL, a novel training\nmethodology that incorporates KL divergence control, reference policy\nresetting, and a diverse suite of tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals that\nRL-trained models consistently outperform base models across a wide range of\npass@k evaluations, including scenarios where base models fail entirely\nregardless of the number of attempts. We further show that reasoning boundary\nimprovements correlates strongly with task competence of base model and\ntraining duration, suggesting that RL can explore and populate new regions of\nsolution space over time. These findings offer new insights into the conditions\nunder which RL meaningfully expands reasoning boundaries in language models and\nestablish a foundation for future work on long-horizon RL for reasoning.

        "summary": "Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded\nscenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum\ngeneration length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length\nincreases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on\n''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic\nlong-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT\ndata, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and\nconsistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In\nthis work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely\nfrom scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality\ntext generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a\nbase model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that\nfacilitates planning and refinement during the writing process.

After a 3-hour\nfine-tuning with 1K examples, our Multiverse-32B stands as the only\nopen-sourced non-AR model achieving performance on par with leading AR-LLMs of\nthe same scale, evidenced by AIME24 & 25 scores of 54% and 46%, respectively.\nMoreover, our budget control experiments show that Multiverse-32B exhibits\nsuperior scaling, outperforming AR-LLMs by 1.87% on average using the same\ncontext length. Such scaling further leads to practical efficiency gain,\nachieving up to 2x speedup across varying batch sizes. We have open-sourced the\nentire Multiverse ecosystem, including data, model weights, engine, supporting\ntools, as well as complete data curation prompts and detailed training and\nevaluation recipes.",

While the open development of large\nhigh-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent\nprogress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large\npart due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication\npipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new\npre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be\nautomatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our\npipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of\nmeaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel\nselection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our\npipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant\nmodels than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and\nprincipled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both\nduplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.\nFinally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common\nCrawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)\nmultilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and\nevaluation codebases.",

        "summary": "We introduce MiniMax-M1, the world's first open-weight, large-scale\nhybrid-attention reasoning model. MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention\nmechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model,\nwhich contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters\nactivated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1\nmillion tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning\nattention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time\ncompute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that\nrequire processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained\nusing large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including\nsandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to\nM1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel\nRL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling\nweights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.\nCombining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on\n512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just\n$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K\nthinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate\nphase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our\nmodels are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the\noriginal DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex\nsoftware engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks.

        "summary": "Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase\nalignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have\nexposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.\nConcurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning\ncapabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.\nAddressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and\neffective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified\nchallenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high\ncomputational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)\nevaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our\napproach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that\nsignificantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To\noperationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision\ntraining objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to\nprevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value\ncaching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree\nsearch. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.\nAdditionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model\n(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)\nto accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are\npublicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project\nhomepage is at https://q-rz.github.io/p/saffron .",

        "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive\ncapabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their\nlarge-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their\neffectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent\ndiscrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the\ngeneral domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical\nlimitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2)\nheightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation\nprocesses, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical\nscenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data\ncuration procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data\nnot only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and\ngeneral-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual\nquestion answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a\nmultimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the\ncurated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu\nundergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its\ntask-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the\npotential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm\nto enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop\nMedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal\nand textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model\nassessment.

        "summary": "Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their\nresponses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how\neffectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In\nan ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would\nexpect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers\nto correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to\nincorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For\neach problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator\nwith access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,\nafter which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse\nrange of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific\nreasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language\nmodels including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,\neven under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show\nresistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To\nmitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like\nprogressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously\nattempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help\nmodels achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of\npotential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model\noverconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in\nLLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in\nself-improvement.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in audio-text large language models (LLMs) have opened new\npossibilities for music understanding and generation. However, existing\nbenchmarks are limited in scope, often relying on simplified tasks or\nmulti-choice evaluations that fail to reflect the complexity of real-world\nmusic analysis. We reinterpret a broad range of traditional MIR annotations as\ninstruction-following formats and introduce CMI-Bench, a comprehensive music\ninstruction following benchmark designed to evaluate audio-text LLMs on a\ndiverse set of music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. These include genre\nclassification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification,\npitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal\ntechnique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music\ntagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges\nin MIR research. Unlike previous benchmarks, CMI-Bench adopts standardized\nevaluation metrics consistent with previous state-of-the-art MIR models,\nensuring direct comparability with supervised approaches. We provide an\nevaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including\nLTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant\nperformance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture,\nchronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of\ncurrent models in addressing MIR tasks. CMI-Bench establishes a unified\nfoundation for evaluating music instruction following, driving progress in\nmusic-aware LLMs.",

        "summary": "Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have expanded their\ncapabilities to interactive agent tasks, yet existing benchmarks remain limited\nto single-agent or text-only environments. In contrast, real-world scenarios\noften involve multiple agents interacting within rich visual and linguistic\ncontexts, posing challenges with both multimodal observations and strategic\ninteractions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Visual Strategic Bench\n(VS-Bench), a multimodal benchmark that evaluates VLMs for strategic reasoning\nand decision-making in multi-agent environments. VS-Bench comprises eight\nvision-grounded environments spanning cooperative, competitive, and\nmixed-motive interactions, designed to assess agents' ability to predict\nothers' future moves and optimize for long-term objectives. We consider two\ncomplementary evaluation dimensions, including offline evaluation of strategic\nreasoning by next-action prediction accuracy and online evaluation of\ndecision-making by normalized episode return. Extensive experiments of fourteen\nleading VLMs reveal a significant gap between current models and optimal\nperformance, with the best models attaining 47.8% prediction accuracy and 24.3%\nnormalized return. We further conduct in-depth analyses on multimodal\nobservations, test-time scaling, social behaviors, and failure cases of VLM\nagents. By standardizing the evaluation and highlighting the limitations of\nexisting models, we envision VS-Bench as a foundation for future research on\nstrategic multimodal agents.

        "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) pretrained on large-scale multimodal datasets\nencode rich visual and linguistic knowledge, making them a strong foundation\nfor robotics. Rather than training robotic policies from scratch, recent\napproaches adapt VLMs into vision-language-action (VLA) models that enable\nnatural language-driven perception and control. However, existing VLAs are\ntypically massive--often with billions of parameters--leading to high training\ncosts and limited real-world deployability. Moreover, they rely on academic and\nindustrial datasets, overlooking the growing availability of\ncommunity-collected data from affordable robotic platforms. In this work, we\npresent SmolVLA, a small, efficient, and community-driven VLA that drastically\nreduces both training and inference costs, while retaining competitive\nperformance. SmolVLA is designed to be trained on a single GPU and deployed on\nconsumer-grade GPUs or even CPUs. To further improve responsiveness, we\nintroduce an asynchronous inference stack decoupling perception and action\nprediction from action execution, allowing higher control rates with chunked\naction generation. Despite its compact size, SmolVLA achieves performance\ncomparable to VLAs that are 10x larger. We evaluate SmolVLA on a range of both\nsimulated as well as real-world robotic benchmarks and release all code,\npretrained models, and training data.",

However, when spatial\ninformation is obscured, these models struggle to capture purely temporal\npatterns. We introduce SpookyBench, a benchmark where information is\nencoded solely in temporal sequences of noise-like frames, mirroring natural\nphenomena from biological signaling to covert communication. Interestingly,\nwhile humans can recognize shapes, text, and patterns in these sequences with\nover 98% accuracy, state-of-the-art VLMs achieve 0% accuracy. This performance\ngap highlights a critical limitation: an over-reliance on frame-level spatial\nfeatures and an inability to extract meaning from temporal cues. Furthermore,\nwhen trained in data sets with low spatial signal-to-noise ratios (SNR),\ntemporal understanding of models degrades more rapidly than human perception,\nespecially in tasks requiring fine-grained temporal reasoning. Overcoming this\nlimitation will require novel architectures or training paradigms that decouple\nspatial dependencies from temporal processing.

Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited\nworking memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model\ninference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and\nGPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as\nreasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences.\nThe reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and\nconclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During\ngeneration, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states\nof the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning\nmechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages\nthroughout reasoning.

To answer this question, we evaluate over 20\nopen-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including\nmath, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard\ninstruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in\nmath fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this\nphenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using\nmath-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space\nrepresentation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT\ninduces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves\ngeneral-domain structure.

        "summary": "The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a\nlongstanding focus of research. Recent works have further enhanced these\ncapabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming\nsignificant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly,\nsome studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance\nreasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the\nQwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500,\nAMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like\nLlama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although\nQwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on\nlarge-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular\nbenchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be\nunreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully\nsynthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a\nclean dataset we call RandomCalculation. Using these leakage-free datasets, we\nshow that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while\nnoisy or incorrect signals do not. We advocate for evaluating RL methods on\nuncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure\ntrustworthy conclusions.",

Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader\nchallenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context,\nrequiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning\ndifferent temporal scales and sources.

We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs\nnatively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:\nweak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional\napproaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect\nSmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our\ninnovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints\ninto design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure\ncombining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward\nnetworks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model\ncapacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a\npre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch\nexpert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding\nstorage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for\nmemory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to\nslash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and\nSmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and\neven outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly\neliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both\nmodels exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB\nand 8GB of memory respectively.

However, most\nexisting approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific\n(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like\nmath and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of\nunsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this\npaper, we ask the question \"Is it possible to generalize these System 2\nThinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from\nunsupervised learning?\" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning\nto explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and\ncandidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization\nwith respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers\n(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy\nvalue to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions\nthrough gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across\nboth discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale\nfaster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an\nup to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,\nFLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2\nThinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs\noutperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward\npasses. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models\non most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,\nsuggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,\nEBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking\ncapabilities of models.",

This survey provides the\nfirst systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized\naround three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how\nto evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,\nmodels, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages\n(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and\narchitectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,\ntextual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems).

To bridge this gap, we introduce Kwai Keye-VL, an\n8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge\nperformance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust\ngeneral-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on\ntwo core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens\nwith a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe\nfeatures a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,\nfollowed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process.

To validate our approach,\nwe conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly\ncompetitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1).

        "summary": "Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved\nperformance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often\nsignificantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world\nscenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the\nperformance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models\nstill perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4\nresolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with\ndifferent resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,\nnamely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides\nwhether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output\na special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing\nEfficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or\nthresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by\ncase. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding\ncapability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens\non simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge\nstrategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully\ndesign a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and\nreasonable image resize call ratio.

While closed-source RLMs such as GPT-o3\ndemonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, their proprietary nature limits\ntransparency and reproducibility. Although many open-source projects aim to\nclose this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical\nresources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders\nreproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development,\nwe introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on\nthe Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing\nopen-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a\ncarefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT\ntrajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To\nenhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce\nContext-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates\nlength-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage\ncontext-aware RL training.

        "summary": "Recent advances in large reasoning models highlight Reinforcement Learning\nwith Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a promising method for enhancing AI's\ncapabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it\nremains unclear whether RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or\nmerely amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for\nimproved precision. This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases\ntoken-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,\nanswer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain\npaths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken\ntogether, these findings reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning\nhorizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic\ninnovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that\nseed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.",

        "summary": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding maps natural language instructions\nto precise interface locations for autonomous interaction. Current\nreinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as\nhit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature\nof spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally\nforms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI\nGaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G^2), a principled reward framework that\nmodels GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface\nplane. GUI-G^2 incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point\nrewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions\ncentered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment\nby measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target\nregions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance\nmechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions.\nThis framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to\ndense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich\ngradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions.\nExtensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro\nbenchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G^2, substantially outperforms\nstate-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of\n24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro.

        "summary": "Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D\nimages is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved\nthis by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.\nHowever, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction\nparadigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible\nsemantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and\ngenerate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and\nunderstanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent\nnovel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from\nonly sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model\nthat can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics\n(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge\nintegration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),\ntrained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language\nembeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.\nFinally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language\ninformation onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language\nqueries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority\nof our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and\ngeneralizability.

        "summary": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights\nof a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a\nlow-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities\nbetween these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates\nlow-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a\nsingle low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design\ninherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization,\nand roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the\ninfinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable\nfeature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks\nvalidate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on\nMNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+\n(90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation,\nfine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image\nfidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to\nscores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.",

Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face\nrestoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and\nselfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task\ncategories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new\nstate-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains.

        "summary": "Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a\npowerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and\ngreater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling.\nHowever, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we\nidentify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to\nsafeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts,\nexposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first\nsystematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety\nweaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial\ninterleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of\ndLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional\nmodeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked\nspans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic\nfiltering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard\nalignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned\ndLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed\nin the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA\nsignificantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously\noverlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves\nup to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior\nbaseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and\nby 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of\nharmful content in the jailbreak prompt. Our findings underscore the urgent\nneed for rethinking safety alignment in this emerging class of language models.\nCode is available at https://github.com/ZichenWen1/DIJA.",

        "title": "Should We Still Pretrain Encoders with Masked Language Modeling?",
        "summary": "Learning high-quality text representations is fundamental to a wide range of\nNLP tasks. While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked\nLanguage Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models\npretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as\nencoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation\nbenchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent\nadvantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model\nand data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of\nlarge-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30\nmodels ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over\n15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM\ngenerally yields better performance across text representation tasks,\nCLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning\nstability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic\ntraining strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal\nperformance under a fixed computational training budget. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that this strategy becomes more appealing when initializing from\nreadily available pretrained CLM models (from the existing LLM ecosystem),\nreducing the computational burden needed to train best-in-class encoder models.\nWe release all project artifacts at https://hf.co/MLMvsCLM to foster further\nresearch.",

        "summary": "Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying\ncomputational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive.\nExisting efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or\nadaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both\nsimultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework\nthat combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.\nMoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter\nefficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by\ndynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This\nallows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still\nactive at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency\nby selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core\nmechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the\nfirst recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory\nfootprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms\na new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it\nsignificantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,\nwhile delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive\nbaselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards\nlarge-model quality without incurring large-model cost.",

        "summary": "We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables\nReinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for\nany AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with\nagent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves\ncomplete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless\nintegration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using\nframeworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from\nscratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as\nMarkov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a\nhierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment\nmodule, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into\ntraining transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such\nas multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we\nintroduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent\nobservability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent\nfinetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented\ngeneration, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous\nimprovements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent\ntraining and deployment.",

Ovis2.5 integrates a\nnative-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native,\nvariable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and\npreserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense\ncontent like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to\nmove beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including\nself-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional\n\"thinking mode\" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced\naccuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive\nfive-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins\nwith foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through\nlarge-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning\nenhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ\nmultimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant\nend-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and\nOvis2.5-2B. The latter continues the \"small model, big performance\" philosophy\nof Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios.

        "summary": "Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,\nrecent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the\nreasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning\ntasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently\noffers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform\ndiverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning\ncapabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this\ndirection by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for\nenabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by\nautonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and\ncomputational operations via executable code. This approach not only\nfacilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,\nrotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,\nall while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these\noperations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:\nan initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,\nfollowed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually\ncollect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the\nlearning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy\nOptimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies\ndistinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning\nexploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental\nanalysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20\nbenchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,\nparticularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning\ntasks.",

We reveal that this happens\nwhen minimal score differences between images are amplified after\nnormalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to\nover-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation\nprocess. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference\nreward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score\nmaximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training.

        "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucinations, saying\nthings that are not actually in the image, and language shortcuts, where they\nskip the visual part and just rely on text priors. These issues arise because\nmost post-training methods for VLMs rely on simple verifiable answer matching\nand supervise only final outputs, leaving intermediate visual reasoning without\nexplicit guidance. As a result, VLMs receive sparse visual signals and often\nlearn to prioritize language-based reasoning over visual perception. To\nmitigate this, some existing methods add visual supervision using human\nannotations or distilled labels from external large models. However, human\nannotations are labor-intensive and costly, and because external signals cannot\nadapt to the evolving policy, they cause distributional shifts that can lead to\nreward hacking. In this paper, we introduce Vision-SR1, a self-rewarding method\nthat improves visual reasoning without relying on external visual supervisions\nvia reinforcement learning. Vision-SR1 decomposes VLM reasoning into two\nstages: visual perception and language reasoning. The model is first prompted\nto produce self-contained visual perceptions that are sufficient to answer the\nquestion without referring back the input image. To validate this\nself-containment, the same VLM model is then re-prompted to perform language\nreasoning using only the generated perception as input to compute reward. This\nself-reward is combined with supervision on final outputs, providing a balanced\ntraining signal that strengthens both visual perception and language reasoning.\nOur experiments demonstrate that Vision-SR1 improves visual reasoning,\nmitigates visual hallucinations, and reduces reliance on language shortcuts\nacross diverse vision-language tasks.",

        "summary": "We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that\nsignificantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference\nefficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade\nReinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through\na two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for\nrefined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial\nimprovements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To\noptimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that\ndynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising\nperformance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)\nstrategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,\neffectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively\nenable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\\% gain in overall reasoning\nperformance and a 4.05times inference speedup compared to its predecessor,\ni.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as\nGUI interaction and embodied agency.

        "summary": "In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,\nachieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance\nbeing quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but\nmore challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely\non expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags\nsignificantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for\ntransforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between\nopen-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains.

        "summary": "Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful\nalternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering\nefficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the\npractical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural\nconstraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static\nlength allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths\ncripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant\ncomputational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While\nthe inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses\ninternal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given\ntask. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce\nDAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive\nLength Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two\nphases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial\nlength and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided\nby a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL\ndynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation\nregions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully\ndeveloped. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves\nperformance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned\nfixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency\nby achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length\nconstraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap\nwith their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient\nand capable generation.",

In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged\nas a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this,\nthe factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this\nwork, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that\nproduces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly\nextends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and\nNemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1\npercentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of\n14 benchmark evaluations.

Remarkably, a 3B model trained for\n180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token\nbudget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on\nsynthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to\nrephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.\nOverall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating\nhigh-quality synthetic pretraining data.

        "summary": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over long documents typically involves\nsplitting the text into smaller chunks, which serve as the basic units for\nretrieval. However, due to dependencies across the original document,\ncontextual information is often essential for accurately interpreting each\nchunk. To address this, prior work has explored encoding longer context windows\nto produce embeddings for longer chunks. Despite these efforts, gains in\nretrieval and downstream tasks remain limited. This is because (1) longer\nchunks strain the capacity of embedding models due to the increased amount of\ninformation they must encode, and (2) many real-world applications still\nrequire returning localized evidence due to constraints on model or human\nbandwidth.\n  We propose an alternative approach to this challenge by representing short\nchunks in a way that is conditioned on a broader context window to enhance\nretrieval performance -- i.e., situating a chunk's meaning within its context.\nWe further show that existing embedding models are not well-equipped to encode\nsuch situated context effectively, and thus introduce a new training paradigm\nand develop the situated embedding models (SitEmb). To evaluate our method, we\ncurate a book-plot retrieval dataset specifically designed to assess situated\nretrieval capabilities. On this benchmark, our SitEmb-v1 model based on BGE-M3\nsubstantially outperforms state-of-the-art embedding models, including several\nwith up to 7-8B parameters, with only 1B parameters.

        "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have\ndemonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as\ndeep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing\nmulti-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with\nsophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less\ncapable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we\nintroduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables\nnative end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent\nsystem (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple\nagents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model\ndynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate\nmulti-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end\nchain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent\ndistillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into\nchain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use\nagentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve\nthe models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the\nresulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies\ndemonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across\ndiverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the\nentire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,\nand the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point\nfor future research on agent models and agentic RL.",

Agents must not only gather and interpret\nvast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources,\nweigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as\nhuman experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its\nimportance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future\nprediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and\nretrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce\nFutureX, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically\ndesigned for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the\nlargest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting\nreal-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated\npipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent\nmodels, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of\nexternal tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source\nDeep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive\nreasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide\nin-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in\nfuture-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the\ntemporal validity.

With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated\nsearch agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans\nfrom this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such\n\"wide-context\" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated\ndue to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nWideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these\nlarge-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated\nquestions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains,\ngrounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale\natomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange\nit into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline\nensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We\nbenchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including\nsingle-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most\nsystems achieve overall success rates near 0\\%, with the best performer\nreaching just 5\\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple\nhuman testers can achieve a near 100\\% success rate. These results demonstrate\nthat present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale\ninformation seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and\ndevelopment in agentic search.

Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and\nauditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic\nmemory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world\nknowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal\nformat, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment.\nGiven an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative\nreasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the\ntask. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal\nagents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.\nM3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's\nperspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse\nscenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test\nkey capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding,\ngeneral knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning.

        "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language\nModel (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to\nproduce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT\nreasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate\ninferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT\nreasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore\nfurther. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and\ninvestigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from\nin-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning\npaths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is\nfundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the\ntraining data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning\nvia three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,\nwe design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs\nfrom scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution\nconditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that\nvanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a\ndeeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the\nongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.",

With the development of Large\nReasoning Models, many studies have demonstrated that step-by-step reasoning\nduring test-time helps improve listwise ranking performance. However, due to\nthe scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform\npoorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of\nreasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we\nfirst propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis\nframework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and\napplies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A\nself-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data\nquality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we\nfurther propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a\nreinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement.\nDuring the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a\nmulti-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based\nreward. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained reasoning-intensive\nreranker ReasonRank outperforms existing baselines significantly and\nalso achieves much lower latency than pointwise reranker Rank1.

Given the LLM's diminished reasoning\nover extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches\nremain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall\nshort due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often\noverlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within\nlong-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle\nthat narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving\ninterplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,\nanalogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the\nbrain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes\niterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.\nIn each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,\nthen integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory\npool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query\nresolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+\ntokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative\ngains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals\nthat ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global\ncomprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for\nretrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

By amortizing computation across common prefixes and\npruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update\ncompute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity.

Empirically,\nDuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average\ntranslation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical\nreasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,\nand enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading\ncomputation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,\nand annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI\nagents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing\nagent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after\ndeployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving\nenvironments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution\ntechniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction\ndata and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation\nfor self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation\nmodels with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems.\nIn this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for\nself-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified\nconceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of\nself-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components:\nSystem Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a\nfoundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this\nframework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques\nthat target different components of the agent system. We also investigate\ndomain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as\nbiomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are\ntightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated\ndiscussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for\nself-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their\neffectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and\npractitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents,\nlaying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and\nlifelong agentic systems.",

        "summary": "Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities\nand impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and\nprecise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar\nperformance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced\nspatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,\nusually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.\nHowever, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often\nprohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel\nbenchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and\nreasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging\nsimulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning\nenvironments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained\nevaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs\nstruggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive\ncontrol.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks\nthrough test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting.\nHowever, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high\ncomputational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think\nwith Confidence (DeepConf), a simple yet powerful method that enhances both\nreasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages\nmodel-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality\nreasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model\ntraining or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into\nexisting serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning\ntasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.\nNotably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up\nto 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full\nparallel thinking.",

A further human study reveals that models often produce correct\nanswers with flawed reasoning, leading to an over 30% gap in reasoning accuracy\ncompared to humans.

        "title": "From Scores to Skills: A Cognitive Diagnosis Framework for Evaluating\n  Financial Large Language Models",
        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for financial applications,\nyet their suitability for this high-stakes domain remains largely unproven due\nto inadequacies in existing benchmarks. Existing benchmarks solely rely on\nscore-level evaluation, summarizing performance with a single score that\nobscures the nuanced understanding of what models truly know and their precise\nlimitations. They also rely on datasets that cover only a narrow subset of\nfinancial concepts, while overlooking other essentials for real-world\napplications. To address these gaps, we introduce FinCDM, the first cognitive\ndiagnosis evaluation framework tailored for financial LLMs, enabling the\nevaluation of LLMs at the knowledge-skill level, identifying what financial\nskills and knowledge they have or lack based on their response patterns across\nskill-tagged tasks, rather than a single aggregated number. We construct\nCPA-QKA, the first cognitively informed financial evaluation dataset derived\nfrom the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) examination, with comprehensive\ncoverage of real-world accounting and financial skills. It is rigorously\nannotated by domain experts, who author, validate, and annotate questions with\nhigh inter-annotator agreement and fine-grained knowledge labels. Our extensive\nexperiments on 30 proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs show that\nFinCDM reveals hidden knowledge gaps, identifies under-tested areas such as tax\nand regulatory reasoning overlooked by traditional benchmarks, and uncovers\nbehavioral clusters among models. FinCDM introduces a new paradigm for\nfinancial LLM evaluation by enabling interpretable, skill-aware diagnosis that\nsupports more trustworthy and targeted model development, and all datasets and\nevaluation scripts will be publicly released to support further research.",
