We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by\nintegrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,\nLongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality\nreasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;\n(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought\nsupervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a\ntraining infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement\nSequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a\nvLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for\nefficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves\nstrong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also\noutperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal\nreasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on\nour LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark.

LongVILA-R1 marks\na firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our\ntraining system for public availability that supports RL training on various\nmodalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and\neven image and video generation models.

      "summary": "Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has\ndemonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language\nmodels (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning\nscenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving\nprocesses. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'\nintrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in\nmulti-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced\nPolicy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training\nmulti-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that\nLLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in\nthe entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following\ninteractions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO\nincorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing\nglobal trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting\nexploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an\nadvantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage\ndifferences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13\nchallenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and\ndeep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL\nalgorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of\nthe tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution\nfor aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory\nmanagement systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual\npersonalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on\nstatic parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to\ntrack user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain\ntext, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or\nintegration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the\ntraining and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective,\nshowing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and\nexternal retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing\nspecific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader\nchallenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context,\nrequiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning\ndifferent temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose\nMemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system\nresource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of\nplaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling\ncost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates\nboth memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes\ncan be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions\nbetween memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning.\nMemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings\ncontrollability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation\nfor continual learning and personalized modeling.",

      "summary": "Large language models have recently evolved from fluent text generation to\nadvanced reasoning across diverse domains, giving rise to reasoning language\nmodels. Among these domains, mathematical reasoning serves as a representative\nbenchmark as it requires precise multi-step logic and abstract reasoning, which\ncan be generalized to other tasks. While closed-source RLMs such as GPT-o3\ndemonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, their proprietary nature limits\ntransparency and reproducibility. Although many open-source projects aim to\nclose this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical\nresources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders\nreproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development,\nwe introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on\nthe Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing\nopen-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a\ncarefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT\ntrajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To\nenhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce\nContext-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates\nlength-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage\ncontext-aware RL training.

The development of Keye-VL rests on\ntwo core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens\nwith a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe\nfeatures a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,\nfollowed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process.

      "summary": "To break the context limits of large language models (LLMs) that bottleneck\nreasoning accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Thread Inference Model (TIM),\na family of LLMs trained for recursive and decompositional problem solving, and\nTIMRUN, an inference runtime enabling long-horizon structured reasoning beyond\ncontext limits. Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited\nworking memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model\ninference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and\nGPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as\nreasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences.\nThe reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and\nconclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During\ngeneration, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states\nof the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning\nmechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages\nthroughout reasoning. Experimental results show that our system sustains high\ninference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU\nmemory. It also delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks and handles\ninformation retrieval challenges that require long-horizon reasoning and\nmulti-hop tool use.",

      "summary": "While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing\npre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from\noverfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization\ncapability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most\nimpactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image,\nas single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We\nintroduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework\nspecifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show\nthat higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones,\nnecessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates\ntwo key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts\nrank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight\nparametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components\nthrough orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and\nits individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model\npersonalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept\nfidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in\ndata-limited and resource-constrained scenarios.

      "summary": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights\nof a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a\nlow-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities\nbetween these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates\nlow-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a\nsingle low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design\ninherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization,\nand roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the\ninfinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable\nfeature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks\nvalidate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on\nMNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+\n(90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget.

While recent large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely\nsolely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing\nspatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in\npractice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or\nmockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that\nperforms UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,\nplanning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to\ndetect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical\nlayout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces\nHTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves\nrobustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that\nautomatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic\nexamples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains\nin UI understanding and code quality.

Latent reasoning tackles this\nbottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's\ncontinuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent\nreasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the\nemerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role\nof neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,\nhighlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.\nNext, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including\nactivation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning\nstrategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we\ndiscuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked\ndiffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning\nprocesses.

As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be\nunreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully\nsynthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a\nclean dataset we call RandomCalculation.

      "summary": "Recent advances in large reasoning models highlight Reinforcement Learning\nwith Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a promising method for enhancing AI's\ncapabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it\nremains unclear whether RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or\nmerely amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for\nimproved precision. This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases\ntoken-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,\nanswer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain\npaths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken\ntogether, these findings reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning\nhorizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic\ninnovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that\nseed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.",

This survey provides the\nfirst systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized\naround three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how\nto evolve.

      "title": "Should We Still Pretrain Encoders with Masked Language Modeling?",
      "summary": "Learning high-quality text representations is fundamental to a wide range of\nNLP tasks. While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked\nLanguage Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models\npretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as\nencoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation\nbenchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent\nadvantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model\nand data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of\nlarge-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30\nmodels ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over\n15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM\ngenerally yields better performance across text representation tasks,\nCLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning\nstability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic\ntraining strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal\nperformance under a fixed computational training budget. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that this strategy becomes more appealing when initializing from\nreadily available pretrained CLM models (from the existing LLM ecosystem),\nreducing the computational burden needed to train best-in-class encoder models.\nWe release all project artifacts at https://hf.co/MLMvsCLM to foster further\nresearch.",

      "summary": "Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,\nexisting solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly\nscoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,\nand reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we\nintroduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future\nof AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language\nmodels to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to\nembrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful\nin real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured\nmemory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and\nKnowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls\nand coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,\nreason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We\nvalidate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a\nchallenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution\ncomputer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and\nwhere no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher\naccuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.\nSecond, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual\ninput, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing\nexisting baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance\nstandard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our\nmemory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors\nthe screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers\nintuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.",

      "summary": "Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language\nmodels (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on\nbenchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week,\nit is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or\njust narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20\nopen-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including\nmath, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard\ninstruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in\nmath fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this\nphenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using\nmath-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space\nrepresentation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT\ninduces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves\ngeneral-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard\npost-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for\nadvancing reasoning models.",

      "summary": "Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved\nperformance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often\nsignificantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world\nscenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the\nperformance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models\nstill perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4\nresolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with\ndifferent resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,\nnamely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides\nwhether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output\na special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing\nEfficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or\nthresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by\ncase. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding\ncapability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens\non simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge\nstrategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully\ndesign a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and\nreasonable image resize call ratio.

Therefore,\nautomated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has\nsignificant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term\ncolorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features\nto achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local\nparadigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color\nconsistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can\nbe achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically\nextracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.\nSpecifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly\nincludes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color\nConsistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support\nthe DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to\ndynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with\nthe current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce\na Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency\nfusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both\nshort-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the\neffectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color\nconsistency for open-domain animation colorization task.

We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework\nthat combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.\nMoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter\nefficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by\ndynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This\nallows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still\nactive at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency\nby selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core\nmechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the\nfirst recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory\nfootprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms\na new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it\nsignificantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,\nwhile delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive\nbaselines.

      "summary": "Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,\nhave recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most\nexisting approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific\n(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like\nmath and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of\nunsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this\npaper, we ask the question \"Is it possible to generalize these System 2\nThinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from\nunsupervised learning?\" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning\nto explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and\ncandidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization\nwith respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers\n(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy\nvalue to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions\nthrough gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across\nboth discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale\nfaster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an\nup to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,\nFLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2\nThinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs\noutperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward\npasses. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models\non most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,\nsuggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,\nEBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking\ncapabilities of models.",

While\nrecent research has primarily focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in\nMLLMs, a fundamental question persists: Can Multimodal Large Language Models\ntruly perceive the world as humans do? This paper shifts focus from reasoning\nto perception. Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning,\nwe introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented\nbenchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on\nsynthetic images that humans process intuitively. Our findings reveal that\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on our perceptual tasks\ntrivial for humans. Both in-context learning and training on language\nbackbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our\ntasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting\nthat our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than\nfor the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap\nbetween current MLLMs and human perception. We release a representative subset\nof TET tasks in this version, and will introduce more diverse tasks and methods\nto enhance visual generalization in future work.",

Drawing\ninspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles\nof searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep\nResearcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report\ngeneration as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a\npreliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation\nto guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through\na \"denoising\" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism\nthat incorporates external information at each step. The core process is\nfurther enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of\nthe agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the\ndiffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process\nmore timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative\nsearch process.

      "summary": "3D creation has always been a unique human strength, driven by our ability to\ndeconstruct and reassemble objects using our eyes, mind and hand. However,\ncurrent 3D design tools struggle to replicate this natural process, requiring\nconsiderable artistic expertise and manual labor. This paper introduces BANG, a\nnovel generative approach that bridges 3D generation and reasoning, allowing\nfor intuitive and flexible part-level decomposition of 3D objects. At the heart\nof BANG is \"Generative Exploded Dynamics\", which creates a smooth sequence of\nexploded states for an input geometry, progressively separating parts while\npreserving their geometric and semantic coherence.\n  BANG utilizes a pre-trained large-scale latent diffusion model, fine-tuned\nfor exploded dynamics with a lightweight exploded view adapter, allowing\nprecise control over the decomposition process. It also incorporates a temporal\nattention module to ensure smooth transitions and consistency across time. BANG\nenhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface\nregions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how. This\ninteraction can be extended with multimodal models like GPT-4, enabling\n2D-to-3D manipulations for more intuitive and creative workflows.\n  The capabilities of BANG extend to generating detailed part-level geometry,\nassociating parts with functional descriptions, and facilitating\ncomponent-aware 3D creation and manufacturing workflows. Additionally, BANG\noffers applications in 3D printing, where separable parts are generated for\neasy printing and reassembly.

      "summary": "Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a\npowerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and\ngreater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling.\nHowever, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we\nidentify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to\nsafeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts,\nexposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first\nsystematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety\nweaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial\ninterleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of\ndLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional\nmodeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked\nspans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic\nfiltering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard\nalignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned\ndLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed\nin the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA\nsignificantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously\noverlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves\nup to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior\nbaseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and\nby 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of\nharmful content in the jailbreak prompt.

Unlike traditional\napproaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect\nSmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations.

First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure\ncombining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward\nnetworks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model\ncapacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a\npre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch\nexpert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding\nstorage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for\nmemory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to\nslash KV cache requirements.
